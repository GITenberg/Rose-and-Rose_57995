<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>ROSE AND
ROSE</h2>
<p>Fifty years ago, when I was a young medical student, I was in
the habit of spending as many week-ends as possible at home with
my father, to whose practice I was one day to succeed.</p>
<p>On a certain Saturday the only other occupants of the railway
compartment were an artist and his wife.&nbsp; I knew him to be
an artist from certain scraps of his conversation that I
overheard, but I should have guessed it also on the evidence of
his hands and dress.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that he wore a
black velvet tam-o&rsquo;-shanter and trousers tight at the
ankles, as in plays; but his hands were eloquent, and there was a
general careless ease about his tweeds that suggested the
antipodes of any commercial or anxious calling.</p>
<p>After a while he turned to me and asked if I knew the town of
Lowcester.</p>
<p>I said that I had lived in the neighbourhood&mdash;at
Bullingham, five miles away&mdash;all my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to spend a few days at the Crown at
Lowcester,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;looking about to try and find a
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very good house at
Bullingham,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;just empty.&nbsp; Jolly garden
too.&nbsp; As a matter of fact it adjoins ours.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next door to the doctor,&rdquo; said the lady, speaking
now for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would be a great
convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One result of this chance meeting was that they took the house
and we became friends; another was the general shaping of my
life; and a third is this narrative, the fruit of an old
man&rsquo;s egoism and leisure.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put my own case as an example to the medical
profession, but you can&rsquo;t deny there is a kind of fitness
in it: it is surely more proper than not that the doctor who
presides at the birth of a child should continue to take an
interest in that child throughout its life.&nbsp; Being born is,
after all, something of an event, and he who assists in that
adventure and helps to introduce a new soul (not to mention a new
body) to this already overcrowded and over-complicated planet of
ours, ought to be counted as something a little more important
than a jobbing gardener, say, or any other useful ally that the
householder calls in.&nbsp; For no matter how mechanical his
services, he is also an instrument of destiny.</p>
<p>None the less, if accoucheurs were expected to <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>follow the
fortunes of every new arrival from the cradle to the grave one of
two things would happen: either the medical profession would
disappear for want of recruits, or home life (with the addition
of the semi-parental doctor intervening between father and
mother) would become more difficult than it already is.&nbsp;
Perhaps then it is as well that the man-with-the-black-bag
remains the piano-tuner that he more or less appears to be.&nbsp;
But I shall continue to believe that so tremendous an affair as a
birth should carry more fatefulness with it; although for the
well-being of patients I can see that it is better that doctors
should be machines rather than sympathetic temperaments.&nbsp;
Good Heavens! if we were not so mechanical into what sentimental
morasses should we land ourselves!</p>
<p>All this, however, is more or less irrelevant and too much
concerned with myself.&nbsp; But you will find that
preoccupation, I fear, throughout this story, such as it
is.&nbsp; I commenced author, you see, at a time of life when it
is not easy to keep to the point or exclude garrulity.&nbsp; When
one does not take to writing until one is over seventy&mdash;I
shall be seventy-one this year, 1920&mdash;readers must expect a
certain want of business-like adroitness.&nbsp; Had you known me
in the days when I was in practice, before I was established on
the shelf, you would have found me, I hope, direct and forcible
and relevant enough.&nbsp; The stethoscope was mightier than the
pen.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Still,
there is more relevance than perhaps you would think, for I am
coming to a case where the doctor and the newly-born established
an intimacy that was destined to grow and to endure through
life.&nbsp; For, as it chanced, my father died very soon after I
was qualified, and when our new neighbours, the Allinsons, became
parents, it was I who was called in to assist.&nbsp; I was then
twenty-seven.&nbsp; Circumstances of personal friendship and
contiguity alone might have promoted a closer association than is
customary between the babe and the intermediary; but the
controlling factors were the death of the mother, after which
many of the decisions which a mother would have to make devolved
on me; and Rose&rsquo;s delicate little body, which caused her
during her early years to need fairly constant watching.&nbsp;
The result was that until a certain unexpected event happened she
moved about almost exclusively between her father&rsquo;s house
and mine, and was equally at home in both.&nbsp; But even with
such a beginning it never crossed my mind that the strands of our
fate were to be so interwoven.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s father was a landscape painter of rather more
than independent means: sufficient at any rate to make it
possible for him to seek loveliness in no matter how distant a
land.&nbsp; He had sketches which he had made all over Europe, in
Morocco, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>in
Egypt, in Japan.&nbsp; But France was his favourite hunting
ground, partly, I think, because he liked the comments of the
French peasants who stood behind his easel better than those of
any other critic.</p>
<p>Artists, even when they are poor, are enviable men.&nbsp; They
live by enjoyment&mdash;their work is fun&mdash;for even if the
unequal struggle to persuade pigments to reproduce nature fills
them with despair, they are still occupied with beauty, still
seeing only what they want to see, and remote from squalor and
sordidness and the ills of life.</p>
<p>Theodore Allinson took the fullest advantage of his artistic
temperament and his private fortune.&nbsp; The one enabled him to
ignore whatever was unpleasing, and the other to fulfil every
wandering caprice.&nbsp; It was all in keeping with such a
man&rsquo;s destiny that he should have as a next-door neighbour
an ordinary trustworthy fellow like myself, who could be depended
upon to keep an eye on his motherless infant when he was
absent.&nbsp; Or, for that matter, when he was present too.&nbsp;
He would have taken it as a very cruel injustice on the part of
the gods if I had moved to any other part of the kingdom&mdash;as
probably any decently ambitious young man in my position would
have done.&nbsp; How he would have raised his clenched fists to
Heaven and railed against fate!&nbsp; But, luckily for him, I
could eat the lotus too.</p>
<p>My lotus-eating, however, would have been only half as
delightful if Allinson were not my <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>neighbour and his small daughter my
proteg&eacute;e.&nbsp; For he was easy and amusing and full of
whimsical fancies, with a very solid foundation of culture
beneath all, and his little girl was a continual joy.</p>
<p>She had taken to me at once, or at any rate had taken to my
watch&mdash;watches having always been useful links between
infantile patients and their medical men.&nbsp; Mine was a gold
repeater, very satisfying to immature gums and surprising and
amusing to the ear.&nbsp; I still have it, and sophisticated
though the world has grown, and mechanically melodious with
gramophone and piano-player, it still chimes for the young with
all its old allurement.</p>
<p>As Rose developed, the function of the repeater as a mediator
decreased in importance, and she and I took to more ordinary
means of communicating our sympathy; but the watch laid the
foundations and laid them truly.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is extraordinary what a small child&rsquo;s tongue can do
with an honest English name.&nbsp; Every one has had experience
of this fantastic adaptive gift, but none could be more curious
than my own.&nbsp; My name is Greville&mdash;Julius Greville,
M.D., if you please&mdash;and if there is a sound less like
Greville than &ldquo;Dombeen&rdquo; I should like to be told of
it; but Dombeen was Rose&rsquo;s translation <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of what she so
often heard her father call me, and Dombeen I have remained to
her.&nbsp; Of all the music in the world none was more sweet to
me than her cool clear voice calling &ldquo;Dombeen!&nbsp;
Dombeen!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Our gardens were separated only by an old fruit wall with a
gate in it, both sides of the gate being equally Rose&rsquo;s
domain; and I used to rejoice when on returning from my rounds I
saw her dainty proud little head among the fruit bushes.</p>
<p>Briggs, my gardener and my father&rsquo;s gardener before me,
was the happier for her society too, as she circled about him
like a robin and never ceased her inquisitorial functions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, but she do flummox me sometimes,&rdquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;The things that child wants to know!&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t only book-learning that&rsquo;s needed, it&rsquo;s
flower-learning too.&nbsp; It makes me feel that
ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why one flower&rsquo;s blue and another
pink.&nbsp; Man and boy I&rsquo;ve worked in gardens, and with
good head-men over me too when I was learning&mdash;Scotchmen and
all&mdash;but I never heard about that.&nbsp; Never even wondered
about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;So as to look prettier in nosegays&rsquo;
was all I could say; but it must go deeper than that.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>I told her to
ask you, you being a gentleman of learning, but she says,
&lsquo;No, no, Briggs, it&rsquo;s what a gardener ought to
know,&rsquo; and she&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some more nuts of hers to
crack&mdash;&lsquo;Why do some flowers have scent and others
don&rsquo;t?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who discovered that potatoes are
good to eat?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who began to put horse-radish
with beef?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why are butterflies called
butterflies?&rsquo;&nbsp; Really, sir, you ought to take her on,
she makes me seem that ignorant.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t ask me the
things I do know.&nbsp; The funny part of it is,&rdquo; Briggs
went on, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t want to have a garden of her
own.&nbsp; Some children are mad about that, but she
doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; All she wants is to walk about among
the flowers, or stand by me, and watch and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off he went.</p>
<p>He came back a moment later.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be very
good of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to try and find out why
butterflies are called butterflies.&nbsp; My missis wants to know
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember another of Briggs&rsquo; stories of Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The other day,&rdquo; he said&mdash;this was when Rose was
about six&mdash;&ldquo;she brought a tooth&mdash;the one that you
gave her a shilling for if she didn&rsquo;t cry when she went to
have it pulled&mdash;and what do you think?&nbsp; She wanted me
to plant it for her.&nbsp; Plant it!&nbsp; And what for?&nbsp; So
as it would grow into a soldier, as it did in some book
they&rsquo;d been reading to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A soldier!&rsquo; I said, wishing to tease her a
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>little,
&lsquo;why a soldier, I should like to know?&nbsp; Why not a
gardener?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pooh, gardeners!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be any fun.&nbsp; Besides, teeth
don&rsquo;t grow into gardeners anyway, they grow into
soldiers&rsquo;; and she comes out every morning and evening to
water it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s want of interest in work of any kind extended to
games.&nbsp; Her boredom when her father and I were at croquet or
billiards was abysmal, and I could never induce her to persevere
with a mallet.&nbsp; Her playground was the world, and her play
was to be in it, and see it, and, I doubt not, speculate as to
its peculiarities.&nbsp; She liked to have stories read to her,
but she liked better to invent them for herself and relate them
to herself as she walked about, outdoors or in.&nbsp; But when
she could get one&rsquo;s whole attention, which is the
too-often-frustrated desire of most children, she was
happiest.&nbsp; A walk with me in the garden when I was
&ldquo;ab-so-loot-ly&rdquo; idle, without scissors or spud or
preoccupation, was one of her special treats; the tendency of
grown up people to let their eyes wander towards weeds or suckers
or green fly being among her heavy crosses.</p>
<p>But her crosses were few.&nbsp; She must have been one of the
first children for whom those <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in authority made the world primarily
a happy place.&nbsp; It is more or less the rule now, but it was
exceptional then.</p>
<p>Like most little girls, she was interested in young creatures:
more than interested, enchanted by them.&nbsp; The finest horse
in the world&mdash;Iroquois, say, who had just won the
Derby&mdash;the finest cow, the finest sheep, left her calm; but
she trembled with rapture on catching sight of a foal or a calf
or a lamb.&nbsp; If the lamb had a black face she screamed with
joy.&nbsp; As for puppies and kittens, she lost her head
completely over them.&nbsp; Again and again I have had to stop,
when she has been on my rounds with me, while she got down in
order to embrace one of these impostors, and the uglier the
kitten was the more she loved it.&nbsp; I could never break her
of the habit&mdash;an extremely insanitary one, I am
convinced&mdash;of hugging stray kittens.</p>
<p>It was odd that an ugly one should appeal to her more than a
perfect one; but odder that any injured creature had such an
immediate claim on her sympathy.&nbsp; Many children are afraid
of animals that are maimed and in pain: or at any rate they avoid
them.&nbsp; But Rose collected them.&nbsp; Birds with broken
wings, mangy puppies, kittens that had been scalded or
lamed&mdash;her infirmary always contained one or more specimens
of these, and we all had to help in nursing them back to
vigour.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Such
was Rose in those early days when we were still neighbours.&nbsp;
And then came one of the crises in the life of both of us.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I had been on a long day&rsquo;s round and returned tired out,
after eight in the evening, with the doctor&rsquo;s dread in my
mind that another call would be waiting.&nbsp; There was indeed a
telegram, but it was not of the kind that I had feared, but a
worse.&nbsp; It was from the British Consul at Marseilles stating
that Theodore Allinson had died of typhoid fever two days before,
and that his effects were being forwarded home.</p>
<p>Allinson&rsquo;s household consisted at that time of
Rose&rsquo;s nurse and several servants under a cook, and I went
over after dinner to break the news.&nbsp; It was, however,
broken.&nbsp; We had so few telegrams in those days that their
contents always became public, and I found the staff in
tears.&nbsp; Rose, however, I was glad to find, had not been
told.</p>
<p>The next thing was to inform the relatives, chief of whom was
Mrs. Stratton, Theodore&rsquo;s sister, older by a few years,
whose husband was something in the city; and a telegram,
despatched to her the next morning, brought herself and Mr.
Stratton quickly on the scene.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton was as different from her brother as two members
of the same family can be&mdash;and often are.&nbsp; Where he was
gay and insouciant, she was grave and anxious.&nbsp; He was full
of fun and banter; but to her life was real, life was <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>earnest.&nbsp; Where he let things slide she was all for
management and control.&nbsp; She was a big woman too, with a
suggestion always of having her square-sails set and bearing down
on you before the wind.</p>
<p>As for George Stratton, he was the nice quiet somewhat
invertebrate husband that such women capture.</p>
<p>No sooner was Mrs. Stratton in the house than she got to work
and explored every room systematically, sniffing a good deal as
she inspected the canvases in the studio.&nbsp; Drawings were
turned out, documents read, and Rose was sent off to Lowcester to
be properly fitted out with black.&nbsp; I offered to take the
child into my house until the memorial service was over, but Mrs.
Stratton declined; and on this rebuff I disappeared from the
scene and was not again in evidence until the ceremony in the
church, which most of the neighbours and various relations, near
and distant, attended.</p>
<p>I was however called out to a case a few miles away, and was
therefore not present at the luncheon that followed; but I
returned in time to take my place, at the lawyer&rsquo;s
invitation, in the studio to hear the reading of the will, in
which, the lawyer informed me, to my great surprise, I was
mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;Mr. Allinson died
abroad too far away for any of his relatives or friends to attend
the funeral, it has been thought well that now, when they are
convened together in his house, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>they may like to hear what his wishes
were with regard to the disposition of his estate and the
settlement of his affairs.&nbsp; It was fortunate that he was
able to put these wishes in order before his illness had made
that impossible; the document is properly signed and attested and
bears every indication of cool judgment.&nbsp; With your
permission I will now read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never been present before at the reading of a will, and
I am glad not to have had the experience since.&nbsp; It is too
dramatic.&nbsp; Why more plays do not contain a will scene, I
cannot understand.&nbsp; But the dramatic quality is not
all.&nbsp; My objection to such a ceremony is the disappointment
that one has to witness, and perhaps even more the triumph.&nbsp;
Poor human nature&rsquo;s expressions of joy on coming into a few
hundred pounds can be an almost tragic spectacle.</p>
<p>Theodore Allinson had remembered most of his relations and all
of his dependents.&nbsp; Such benefactions came first.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;The remainder of the estate,&rsquo; the lawyer read
on, &lsquo;I leave in trust to my daughter Rose, to be
administered as they think best by her trustees George Stratton
and Julius Greville, until her twentieth birthday, when it will
be hers to do as she wishes with.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer paused again and Mrs. Stratton indicated her
approval of at any rate one of the trustees by a guarded
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Finally,&rsquo;&rdquo; the lawyer went on,
&ldquo;&lsquo;I ask my friend and neighbour Julius Greville to
become <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>my
daughter&rsquo;s guardian and foster-father.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words a rustle of astonishment ran round the room,
and no one could have been more astonished than myself.&nbsp;
Mrs. Stratton did more than rustle: she bridled and shot me a
furious glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you hear that, George?&rdquo;
she asked her husband in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said the lawyer, and continued:
&ldquo;&lsquo;guardian and foster-father, reimbursing himself
from her estate for every expense which that duty imposes upon
him, from the present time until she shall become, on her
twentieth birthday, her own mistress.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again, and again the company sought each
other&rsquo;s faces.&nbsp; Mrs. Stratton was scarlet with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s thirteen years!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing that Dr. Greville, not unnaturally, is
unwilling to take so great a responsibility?&rdquo; Mr. Stratton
asked, after a little whispered coaching from his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming to that,&rdquo; said the lawyer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The will continues: &lsquo;I ask Dr. Greville to do this
great thing for me, because I have for him both affection and
respect, and because such neglect towards our Rose as my own
indolence and selfishness have betrayed me into has as far as lay
in his power been corrected by him; also because Rose loves him
and has profound confidence in him.&nbsp; I am conscious,
however, that it is more than I have the right to ask, and <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>if he
declines, which he can do with perfect propriety and not the
faintest suggestion of unfriendliness to me, I wish that Rose may
become the ward of my sister Millicent Stratton, who I am sure
will be delighted to have her, with the same conditions as to
finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
my brother had not entirely taken leave of his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Milly!&rdquo; said her husband soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what do you say?&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton asked
me eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you will decline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Dr. Greville comes to any decision,&rdquo; the
lawyer interposed, &ldquo;there is a letter from the testator
which he ought to read.&nbsp; It was included among the papers of
the deceased, and would have been handed to Dr. Greville earlier
had he not been called away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no need for time or consideration to be
given to such a simple matter as this,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Stratton.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is obvious on the face of it that a
busy country doctor, living alone, can have no fitness for such a
delicate task as the bringing up of a girl from seven to
twenty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s preposterous, and any real friend of my
brother would agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think that Dr. Greville should, in fairness to
himself and to every one concerned, be rushed into a
decision.&nbsp; Here, sir, is the letter&rdquo;; and he handed me
an envelope, which I had the prudence to put in my pocket.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>And so
doing, I rose and left.&nbsp; It is one of the rare compensations
in a general practitioner&rsquo;s life that he can go when he
likes and without ceremony.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that an
engagement is always awaiting us; but it is our privilege first
to suggest it and secondly to be exempted from
cross-examination.</p>
<p>As soon as I was alone I read Theodore&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; I
can give its exact words, as it is one of the very few that I
have kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Greville,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been eating oysters and they&rsquo;ve got me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
only a muddler of a doctor here and I have no hope anyway.&nbsp;
One knows when one&rsquo;s number is up.&nbsp; The only thing
that really worries me is Rose.&nbsp; Be a good fellow and take
charge of her and bring her up to beat the band.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t bear the thought of Milly getting at her and making
her just like all the other women in the world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
made my will, and the Consul here has witnessed it, so you will
find everything in order.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d done more with
my life, but I haven&rsquo;t had a bad time and, after all, after
a certain age one day may as well be one&rsquo;s last as
another.&nbsp; I hate not to see you again, and as for Rose. .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the letter broke off.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George Stratton and his wife were announced before I had
finished dinner, and I went to them <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>not in the best of humour.&nbsp; I
was tired, and the day&rsquo;s events had been disturbing, and I
had been looking forward to a quiet dispassionate review of the
whole matter.&nbsp; It was an evening of unusual charm too, and I
am devoted to the garden in the dusk when there is only enough
wind to carry the scent of flowers and not enough to disperse
it.&nbsp; Such evenings are memorable and precious by their very
infrequency and I have always grieved when one has been
wasted.</p>
<p>Doctors, however, being more naturally, and, I suppose, even
wilfully, at the mercy of other people than anyone else is, I
laid aside my napkin with a sigh of surrender and once again
prepared for duty.</p>
<p>I thought that George looked a little awkward, and I hastened
to put him partly at his ease with a cigar.&nbsp; Mrs. George,
who was clearly on the warpath, was not to be pacified so
simply.&nbsp; Women aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Even with the spread of
the tobacco habit they cannot be bought, as a man and brother
can, by a Corona Corona; while a whisky-and-soda is powerless, at
any rate with the Milly Strattons of this earth.</p>
<p>She came to the point at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must excuse
such an informal and probably inconvenient call,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but we have to leave by an early train and I want to get
everything settled.&nbsp; How soon will Rose be ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To come to us,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
surely <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>don&rsquo;t, on consideration, propose to fall in with
my poor brother&rsquo;s very curious idea of keeping his child
from her own kith and kin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that I have any way out of it,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The terms of the will were that I was to be
Rose&rsquo;s guardian unless I had an insuperable objection; in
which case she was to go to you.&nbsp; But although I am aware
that her presence here will cause certain readjustments and that
possibly the child might be happier where there were more young
companions, I have no objection that for a moment could be called
insuperable.&nbsp; Besides, your brother was a friend of mine
whom I knew pretty well&mdash;possibly, through our contiguity,
even better than you&mdash;and it was his wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wish!&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton echoed
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how capable was he, do you
consider, of making a sensible wish?&nbsp; At any time, but
particularly when he was so ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will sounded sensible enough to me,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has not been contested.&nbsp; What do you
think, Stratton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stratton was not there to talk.&nbsp; It was the grey
mare&rsquo;s evening out and he was silenced almost before he had
completed the preliminary stages of lip-opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if my brother had not been at the moment so ill as
to be mentally unhinged,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stratton, &ldquo;you
must agree that the case is most peculiar.&nbsp; Here am I, his
own sister, with children of my own more or less of Rose&rsquo;s
age, the <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>properly equipped and natural person to bring up this
motherless and fatherless child, and instead she is left to the
tender mercies of a young man&mdash;and an unmarried
man&mdash;whose only claim is that he lived next door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his only claim,&rdquo; I suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is something to have known the family for many years and to have
brought the child into the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere accidents of adjacency and profession,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Stratton.</p>
<p>I granted that, but added that chance could rarely be
separated from destiny.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton hastened to assure me that she had no patience
with mystical balderdash.&nbsp; In any case it was absurd that a
busy unmarried doctor should be selected to train an
orphan&mdash;and a female orphan at that&mdash;when the
orphan&rsquo;s own aunt was not only ready to take over the duty
but had been in the dead man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; She was
convinced that ninety-nine out of every hundred men in my
position would have the grace&mdash;the humanity&mdash;to stand
aside and give close relationship precedence.&nbsp; She was also
convinced that no decently-honest judge, if there were such a
person, would hesitate to set the will aside and give her the
custody of her own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>I doubted if the phrase &ldquo;own flesh and blood&rdquo;
could be applied properly to nieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s near enough,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Stratton.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to quibble about
it.&nbsp; But to return to the question of a girl being entrusted
to a young <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>unmarried man, I consider it unsuitable in every
way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not nice,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not proper.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a kind of a
scandal.&nbsp; The idea of a bachelor bringing up a
girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pointed out that I was a little different from most men in
being a doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A doctor!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as though annihilating
at one sniff not only every pretension I might have cherished to
know anything of the healing art, but every vestige of discretion
too, and all my predecessors from Galen onwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; I said mildly, &ldquo;I have been
practising in this neighbourhood for a good many years and I
succeeded a highly-esteemed father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not without your reward,&rdquo; she returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was worth having one of your patients, at any rate, if
you could induce him to leave you his daughter and a nice little
sum to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said George from the sofa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that.&nbsp; You must excuse the
feelings of a sister and&mdash;and an aunt.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; she
continued, wasting no time in the nuances of regret, &ldquo;at
any rate you wouldn&rsquo;t think of accepting this trust if you
didn&rsquo;t marry?&nbsp; You must realize that my poor brother
had your marriage in mind when he made this preposterous
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new idea to me, and it assorted ill with
Allinson&rsquo;s expressed views as to the matrimonial state.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I saw him more often and
knew him more intimately in his latter days than you could have
done.&nbsp; He gave me no hint of wishing to see me
married.&nbsp; I could even give you a proof to the contrary,
only I should not wish to run the risk of offending
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton intimated that she should like to hear anything
that her poor brother had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has
often remarked what a relief it was to be able to come over to me
in the evening, to a house where there were no women about to
have to be polite to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgraceful!&rdquo; said Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But his own dislike of refinement and the convenances is
one thing; the bringing up of his daughter is another.&nbsp; I
repeat that not even he would wish to leave his only child to the
mercies of a bachelor.&nbsp; I claim to know something of his
character,&rdquo; she went on: &ldquo;we were girl and boy
together.&nbsp; He would have added the clause to the will if he
had been more himself.&nbsp; I am convinced of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I pointed out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One can take wills only as they are framed.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that so, Stratton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except in very exceptional cases, yes,&rdquo; said
George, with an heroic effort.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton became tearful and turned on her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You never support me,&rdquo; she <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>complained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You allow any one to override
me.&nbsp; As if I didn&rsquo;t know my own brother better than
strangers could!&nbsp; His wish&mdash;more, his
decision&mdash;would be that Dr. Greville should marry if he
accepted the care of Rose.&nbsp; Of course you must marry,&rdquo;
she added, to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;How old are you?&mdash;you look
about thirty&mdash;every man of thirty should be married.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s always something wrong with bachelors.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t allow&mdash;can we, George?&mdash;our niece to be
brought up by a bachelor of thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many good men have been bachelors,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I shall be
surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; I rejoined: &ldquo;our
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be blasphemous,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely being historical,&rdquo; I explained
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to compare yourself with Him,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all helps to confirm my worst
fears.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t intend to pass on to other matters
connected with this deplorable affair; but that remark of yours
has forced me to.&nbsp; Not only are you young and unmarried, but
you treat sacred things with levity.&nbsp; I have not been
prying, though you may think so&mdash;I should scorn the
action&mdash;I have not been prying or asking questions, but I
have learned that you are not a churchgoer.&nbsp; And not just
because you&rsquo;re a doctor either,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not an excuse that I was about to <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>make,&rdquo;
I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should not be a churchgoer whatever
happened.&nbsp; It would involve suggestions of belief that I
could not make and should not like to be dishonest
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An agnostic!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
terrible!&nbsp; O my poor Rose!&rdquo;&nbsp; She began to be
tearful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more agnostics than you know of,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this country, where religious questions are
rarely asked and more rarely answered, no census of them could
ever be taken.&nbsp; You probably not only know but esteem and
trust scores of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this she made no verbal reply, but settled down steadily to
sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Stratton,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are taking the gloomiest view without the faintest reason.&nbsp;
You might just as well look on the case brightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said George, who had gone to his
wife&rsquo;s side and was stroking her with reassuring
movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always
siding against me!&nbsp; Come away.&nbsp; It is no use staying
here or talking any more.&nbsp; Such selfishness I never saw in
all my life.&nbsp; But no good will come of it, I feel
that.&nbsp; My poor little Rose, my poor little Rose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned to look at me with an intense yearning in her
exceedingly damp features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not decide to-night,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall pray that you may have the best
guidance,&rdquo; she assured me.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>I
thanked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall know in the morning, early,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;how your prayers have been answered&rdquo;; and she
stumbled away, blind with tears.</p>
<p>George followed her, pausing only for a moment to inflict upon
me one of those grasps in which man assures man of understanding
and allegiance, and re-states the solidarity of sex.&nbsp; It
hurt horribly, and I nursed my hand for some moments; but it was
comforting too.</p>
<p>It was late when I went to bed, for there was much to do and
plan.&nbsp; I was not too happy about the future and my new
responsibilities, but one thought as I turned out the gas gave me
the purest joy&mdash;and that was that I was not George
Stratton.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Allinson had asked a great deal.&nbsp; It meant a kind of
bondage for thirteen years&mdash;and the years between
thirty-four, my present age, and forty-seven ought to be good
ones.&nbsp; Should a young man dedicate them to a child not his
own?&nbsp; Ordinarily a young man would not, but my case was not
quite ordinary.&nbsp; A doctor automatically surrenders to his
profession much of his youthfulness.&nbsp; Some one has said that
the roystering medical student must be forgiven all when it is
remembered how suddenly and completely he has, on qualification,
to be changed into a staid, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>sober and punctual servant of the
public for the rest of his days&mdash;yes, and his nights.&nbsp;
And I had always been a little old-fashioned, as we say, and the
circumstance of succeeding to so big a practice so early, and
being accepted favourably by so many of my father&rsquo;s
patients, had not impaired this characteristic.&nbsp; I was
therefore both by nature and by profession more of a predestined
guardian of another man&rsquo;s child than most men even of
forty-four are.</p>
<p>All the same, it was a tremendous responsibility, and it might
result&mdash;I came back to this again and again&mdash;in a
tremendous sacrifice.&nbsp; Because if I agreed to be
Rose&rsquo;s foster-father, I should have to be thorough and
absolute.&nbsp; She might in time go to school, but while she was
my child she would be mine and no one else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I could
not share the duty of bringing her up.&nbsp; This means that the
marriage upon which Mrs. Stratton had set her mind would not
materialize.&nbsp; Whether or not celibacy was going to involve
any kind of martyrdom for me I did not know; certainly up to the
present time I had not fallen in love or felt in danger of doing
so; and that is a good deal to say at thirty-four.&nbsp; But
there were years ahead famous for their susceptibility.</p>
<p>And then, as to education, a girl, even when one can give her
adequate attention, is a disquieting creature.&nbsp; One never
knows of what she is thinking, as she sits there, knitting, or
apparently poring over a book, or arranging flowers without a
sound: <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>more than thinking, plotting even.&nbsp; A boy is
simpler.&nbsp; To begin with, he is rarely being still, and for
the most part he wears his thoughts outside.&nbsp; As for a boy,
if I had one to bring up I don&rsquo;t quite know what I should
teach him, except that he must not step away from fast bowling,
and that it isn&rsquo;t fair to get into a railway compartment
where the only other passengers are a pair of lovers.</p>
<p>During a wakeful night my thoughts traversed the ground again
and again, in unprogressive circles; but amid the dubieties that
crowded on me this steady question periodically challenged
me&mdash;Could you let her be brought up by that Stratton
woman?&nbsp; Then, for the moment, I saw my course clear and
shining: only however to lose it again when the gigantic
difficulties of the task of education&mdash;made infinitely
greater and more difficult by the fact that I was considering
them in the small hours, when no man&rsquo;s judgment is
well-balanced&mdash;arose to darken the future.</p>
<p>Thus pondering and fearing, I fell asleep.</p>
<p>How long I should have overslept, as the result of this
earlier restlessness, had not some gravel rattled on the window,
I cannot say.&nbsp; I hastened to it and peered out.&nbsp; The
sun was high, the scent of the garden came up warm and fresh, and
just below me was Rose herself, all strange and pathetic in her
stiff black clothes, lifting her transparent little face upwards
and calling &ldquo;Dombeen, Dombeen.&nbsp; Oh, I do want you
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>How
could I have disregarded such a sign?&nbsp; Was it not an answer
to Mrs. Stratton&rsquo;s prayer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided finally to take charge of Rose, as her
father wished,&rdquo; I wrote to Mrs. Stratton before she left
for her own home.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My first duty now was to secure Hannah Banks; because it would
be necessary for Rose to have a nurse and steady companion, and I
had never cared greatly for the one in Allinson&rsquo;s
employ.</p>
<p>Hannah Banks, who years before had been my own nurse, was now
in retirement at Lowestoft, living with a married niece on the
annuity that my father had left her; but she expressed her
willingness to re-enter service, and a day or so later her
motherly old face beamed once more upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of you,&rdquo; said Hannah, &ldquo;bringing up
a child&mdash;and a little girl at that&mdash;without anyone to
help!&nbsp; The idea!&nbsp; Of course I came.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
as strong as I used to be, but thank God, I&rsquo;m
tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose took to her instantly, and they established themselves in
a wing of the house, which, for too long much too big for me, was
now becoming human again.&nbsp; Hannah was vigilant but not
fussy: her especial qualities were a kind heart and an unsleeping
thoughtfulness.&nbsp; She could hardly write her own name, and
her reading was confined to the simplest words; but what are
reading and <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>writing compared with the conduct of life?&nbsp; What I
wanted from Hannah was wholesome solicitude and old English
simplicity; I could supply the rest myself, and later on there
would be some regular lessons.</p>
<p>The fact that Hannah had stood in the relation of nurse also
to me made her a little contemptuous of my present parental
airs.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t bring up a boy from the cradle to
boarding-school without detecting lapses from the god, and these
can be remembered even when he is adult and your employer.&nbsp;
Nor, after bringing up a boy like that, can you ever quite lose
the feeling that he is still something of an infant.&nbsp; Since,
to nice women, all men are still something of infants (and, if
sensible, willing to be so), this does not ordinarily matter; but
the attitude may lead to embarrassing results when one is
endeavouring to cut a figure of authority, with a child of
one&rsquo;s own or in one&rsquo;s own charge.&nbsp; How can a
lecture on hygiene be effective when in the middle of it an
officious old lady crosses the lawn with a pair of goloshes in
her hands, and says: &ldquo;Now, Master Julius, put these on
directly.&nbsp; The grass is wringing wet!&rdquo;&nbsp; For I was
still Master Julius to Hannah.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was, besides Hannah, Suzanne.&nbsp; It was one of my
peculiarities&mdash;and how the countryside came to forgive it I
never understood&mdash;to employ <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>a French cook.&nbsp; I had found her
on a walking tour with Theodore Allinson in Normandy in 1880; she
was keeping a wayside inn near Lillebonne, and her husband having
just died, and there being no children, she longed to get away to
a totally new environment.&nbsp; She was then about
thirty-two.&nbsp; Since she made wonderful soups out of nothing
and could set a perfect omelette before you almost before the
order was given, I suggested that she might like to try England
and take service with me; and she jumped at the idea; and with me
she remained, capable, quick and amusing.</p>
<p>Her French was far from the French of Paris, but she had the
rapid Parisian gift of commentary, with a homely provincial
sagacity added.&nbsp; The acquirement of English she disdained,
but just as sailors go round the world on the one word
&ldquo;savvy,&rdquo; so did she, with a similar economy, contrive
to make herself understood in the house and the village.&nbsp;
Indeed, she went farther than to refuse to acquire English, she
forced French on us, so that, for example, we entirely gave up
&ldquo;going to bed&rdquo;: we used instead to &ldquo;alley
coshy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose was devoted to Suzanne and she assimilated a large number
of her phrases&mdash;all of which, I knew only too well, would
have to be unlearned when she came under the control of a real
Mademoiselle.&nbsp; But for the present it was more important
that the child should be happy with this broad-bosomed kindly
Norman, and whatever bad pronunciation she was getting was more
than <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>compensated for by the attainment of certain secrets of
the cuisine.&nbsp; Suzanne could not read a word, but the last
atom of flavour was conserved in every dish that she sent to
table; and what is literature compared with cooking?&nbsp; One is
shadow and the other is substance.&nbsp; She had no
culture.&nbsp; In vain for her had her fellow Norman, Gustave
Flaubert (whose statue she had no doubt seen in Rouen), toiled
all his life after the elusive epithet; but her apple-jelly was
more than novels and her salads were works of art.&nbsp; I used
to look at her, serene among her pots and pans or gathering
lettuces in the garden, and reflect again how little education
has to do with the real progress of the world or the happiness of
mankind.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, Hannah did not appreciate Suzanne.&nbsp;
Like a good rural Englishwoman, she mistrusted all foreigners in
general, and in the present case the feeling was aggravated by
jealousy, and by pique that her own darling Rose could understand
the foreigner&rsquo;s gibberish where she herself could
not.&nbsp; But the house was so managed that the two women seldom
met.&nbsp; Hannah ate in her and Rose&rsquo;s own rooms, while
Suzanne rarely left the kitchen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have said something of Rose&rsquo;s infirmary for crippled
animals.&nbsp; With these creatures and Hannah and Suzanne and
the maids and Briggs and myself, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>she would have had company enough;
but there were others always ready to listen to her.&nbsp; There
was, for instance, Mr. Wellicum.</p>
<p>In those primitive days I not only prescribed medicines but
supplied them, and Mr. Wellicum was my dispenser, as he had been
my father&rsquo;s before me.&nbsp; He had seemed an old man when
I was Rose&rsquo;s age and ventured into his aromatic domain, and
to her therefore he must have worn an air of extreme
antiquity.&nbsp; There was this difference in his attitude to the
two of us: he had disliked, or at any rate discouraged, my
visits, but he rejoiced to have Rose about him.&nbsp; He was a
short, bow-legged, grizzled man, very hairy and ursine, known to
the villagers as &ldquo;Crusty Bob,&rdquo; and by playing tricks
on him the boys increased his bearishness; but to Rose he was the
mildest and most subservient slave.&nbsp; Others, including
myself, his timid employer, were allowed in the dispensary itself
only with ungracious reluctance&mdash;the lobby by the trap-door
in the window being the place of the public&mdash;but Rose could
do as she wished there, always on the one condition that she must
not taste.&nbsp; He even permitted her to help in pill rolling,
and not a few of the village children have been known to beg her
collusion in seeing that their physic was made less nasty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Those were the days before motor-cars&mdash;I did <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>not see a
motor-car until I was well over forty or own one until I was
fifty&mdash;when a country doctor and his horse were allies and
friends.&nbsp; I rode a little, but mostly drove, and Silver and
I were on terms of the closest intimacy.&nbsp; She was a chestnut
mare with a whitey-grey mane and tail: hence her name.</p>
<p>Speed, no doubt, is a great asset, especially for a busy
doctor in a straggling district, but I shall always hold that we
lost spiritually more than we gained materially when we
substituted machinery for the horse.&nbsp; The horse, the
school-book used to tell us, is the friend of man; and man needs
friends.&nbsp; Petrol is his servant or his master, even his
tyrant; petrol smoothes no difficulties, heals no wounds,
restores no vitality, as a horse could do.&nbsp; On the other
hand, justice compels me to admit that it has taken me to many a
sick-bed at a pace that Silver would have thought unjust and have
found impossible.&nbsp; In addition to Silver I had a bay mare
named Jenny, as a second string.&nbsp; Both were affectionate and
gentle, and Rose adored them and took astonishing and terrifying
liberties with them.&nbsp; Some part of the ritual of grooming,
in which she was proud to assist, she even carried into her own
toilet.&nbsp; The peculiar hissing sound which ostlers make when
they are curry-combing, Rose used to imitate (Hannah told me,
with tears of mirth) as she brushed her hair.</p>
<p>That part of the ancient Persians&rsquo; simple system <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of education
for their sons which bore upon the management of a horse (to
shoot straight, manage a horse, and tell the truth, was the
complete curriculum) is being missed to-day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
pretend that Rose could manage one in the full sense of the word,
but she had the qualities which such mastery
demands&mdash;courage and confidence, mental quickness and
sympathy, and a steady hand.&nbsp; It is not to a country&rsquo;s
good when the horse disappears and oil and metal take its place,
for the management of a car is far less educative.&nbsp; To-day,
roughly speaking, only farm-boys and stable-lads are being taught
as the wise old Persians would wish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Then there were the neighbours: the Rector and his family;
Colonel Westerley and his wife; the old people at the post
office, and the butcher and the baker, and, what is more to the
point, the butcher&rsquo;s and the baker&rsquo;s errand
boys.&nbsp; Rose was on the best of terms with all of these.</p>
<p>Some were too anxious to share in her upbringing.&nbsp; I
exempt the butcher&rsquo;s boy and the baker&rsquo;s boy from
this charge, and the old couple at the post office are honourably
acquitted&mdash;or as honourably as persons can be who repeat
telegrams to the whole village&mdash;but the Rector&rsquo;s wife
longed for Rose to join her two daughters in their lessons, and
Mrs. Westerley was consumed by a desire to <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>transform her
into a pianist.&nbsp; The rectory offer I declined, but Rose sat
for a while at Mrs. Westerley&rsquo;s instrument, until it was
decided that whatever genius she might possess lay in some other
direction than music.</p>
<p>Mrs. Westerley, whose garden marched with mine on the other
side, we could do without; but Colonel Westerley was one of
Rose&rsquo;s special intimates.&nbsp; And when I say Colonel, I
mean Colonel.&nbsp; I mean an elderly upright man with a white
moustache and courtly manners, who took the chair at meetings,
and played a good game of croquet, and acted as sidesman on
Sundays; the kind of army aristocrat who, by presenting the plate
with a certain military &eacute;clat, made it a double privilege
for the worshipper to drop in a shilling for God.&nbsp; I have to
explain and amplify in this way because now, after the War, when
I am writing, the word Colonel means nothing of the kind.&nbsp;
Mere youths are colonels.&nbsp; A major called on me yesterday
with a smooth-shaven white face and a baggy umbrella, to ask for
my signature to some teetotal appeal.&nbsp; If I had trodden on
his toe he would very likely have said that it was his
fault.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;Gad&rdquo; has quitted the
language.</p>
<p>Colonel Westerley had all the mildness and Christianity that,
in some odd way, can seed in the composition of a certain kind of
army man, to blossom forth in his retirement.&nbsp; One does not
notice the seeding, but the flowers are very visible.&nbsp; He
had been in India most of his life: had quelled <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>border
insurgencies and killed his country&rsquo;s foes without a
tremor; but now, among the croquet hoops and William Allen
Richardsons, he was the soul of gentle courtesy and the
Rector&rsquo;s right-hand layman.&nbsp; The Colonel took over my
&ldquo;Times&rdquo; at half-price at three o&rsquo;clock every
afternoon, and we shared a library subscription.&nbsp; Mrs.
Westerley knitted continually for bazaars, and read aloud every
evening until it was time for Patience and then bed.</p>
<p>Rose and the Colonel were great friends.&nbsp; I used to see
her watching him as he pruned and grafted, and asking him
searching questions as to the perils of life in India.&nbsp; When
he corroborated her suspicions and stated that it was really true
that snakes got into the bath through the hole that lets the
water out, she instituted a hostility to enter that receptacle
and be washed all over that was very distressing to her
nurse.&nbsp; The Colonel&rsquo;s stories of man-eating tigers had
less serious results.&nbsp; The very good case which he made for
himself as an intrepid fighting man and terror of the jungle
deteriorated, however, when Rose discovered one day that he had
not a single Indian coin to display to her.&nbsp; To see a rupee
in the flesh, so to speak, had suddenly become a necessity,
second only to that of beholding a real live anna, which she
associated in some curious way with Hannah Banks; and the
incompetent old warrior had neither.&nbsp; How one could leave
India and not bring any such souvenirs away, Rose could not <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>comprehend.&nbsp; An ivory model of the Taj Mahal,
proffered in lieu of coinage, had no effect whatever, not even
when fortified by the Colonel&rsquo;s word-picture of the
original by moonlight.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I hardly need say that many of my patients, even the serious
ones, took the liveliest interest in Rose, and since nothing is
so vexing to the matron and even the spinster as the spectacle of
a single man bringing up a young girl, I was naturally well
supplied with advice.&nbsp; All my patients asked about her, but
as for the hypochondriacs, they made Rose a staple of
conversation&mdash;conversation being their principal requirement
from a doctor.&nbsp; Having reported on the progress of their
hypothetical maladies, they got to work at once on Rose&rsquo;s
progress.&nbsp; What was she doing?&nbsp; What was she
reading?&nbsp; Had I any new amusing remarks of hers to
repeat?</p>
<p>I must not give the impression that I was wilfully taking fees
from these people for nothing.&nbsp; They had just enough
discomfort or fear of illness to warrant the request that I
should add them to my visiting list, and I was never an
Abernethy, to call them humbugs and refuse to waste my time under
their roofs; but with less money or more to do they would have
forgotten my existence.&nbsp; Indolence and riches, in others,
are the medical profession&rsquo;s best friends.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>A
country doctor in those days was valued for his sociability as
much almost as for his skill, and there are cases when a
pleasantry or two can do more good than the whole
pharmacopoeia.&nbsp; If he can see the opportunity of being
useful as a mind-doctor as well as the ordinary repairer of
disordered bodies, I think that the practitioner should embrace
it and take a fee for it without a blush.</p>
<p>My own circle of semi-friendly patients was large.&nbsp; There
was Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman, for instance.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman
was the widow of an Irish landlord, a little lady, then between
fifty and sixty, with a great gift of shrewdness and no belief in
mincing her words, who was just sufficiently rheumatic to get
three half-hours a week of my society, and perhaps an extra one
if I chanced to be passing that way on an irregular day.&nbsp;
She lived in luxury in a big house, with a companion called
Julia, and read everything that was published both in books and
periodicals; and everything that she read reminded her of
something.&nbsp; You know the elusive Irish mind leaping from
branch to branch; well, she had that, and a marvellous memory at
the back of it.&nbsp; But whatever might be her theme, she always
came back to Rose, who now and then was deposited at her house by
me in the morning and picked up on my return from my rounds,
replete with exotic food and burdened with gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s the colleen to-day?&rdquo; Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman would say, after the latest ravages wrought by
uric acid on her system had been carefully <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>described.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn the stuff!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s it for, anyway?&nbsp; Just to keep doctors in
affluence, I suppose.&nbsp; If the good God had asked me to help
Him in making the world, which I&rsquo;d take shame to put my
signature to as it is, I&rsquo;d have left uric acid out of
it.&nbsp; Yes, and doctors too!&nbsp; Every doctor is a
confession of failure on the Creator&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you read the article in the &lsquo;Nineteenth
Century&rsquo; on Genesis?&nbsp; Is it the &lsquo;Nineteenth
Century,&rsquo; Julia, or the &lsquo;Contemporary&rsquo;?&nbsp;
It doesn&rsquo;t matter which, they&rsquo;re both half a crown
and not worth it.&nbsp; The man sweeps away the Garden of Eden
like dust on a piano.&nbsp; And that reminds me, we&rsquo;re
going to London to hear Arpeggio.&nbsp; They say he&rsquo;s
better than Liszt, although he has short hair.&nbsp; But
he&rsquo;s a devil among the ladies, just the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it, how these
musicians&mdash;Julia, go and get the Doctor a glass of sherry
and some cake&mdash;it&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it, that no woman
can resist them?&nbsp; Now, a fiddler I can understand.&nbsp; He
stands up to it and makes those fine movements with his delicate
hands; but a pianist, all bent over the box, banging
away&mdash;what can they see in him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell me, what are you doing about Rose&rsquo;s
music?&nbsp; She ought to be taking lessons.&nbsp; A girl&rsquo;s
out of it if she can&rsquo;t play some instrument, and it&rsquo;s
useful too if a dance should be improvised.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
see&mdash;has she good arms?&nbsp; If she has, she ought to play
the fiddle, or the harp, only the harp&rsquo;s so clumsy to take
about.&nbsp; You want a cab every <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>time.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a lovely
instrument.&nbsp; I heard Jenny Lind sing to a harp&mdash;the
sweetest voice.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some fellow in the
&lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo; this week says that Patti has never
been approached: but Jenny Lind was worth a thousand of
her.&nbsp; Patti has too much art: you notice it; Jenny Lind made
you forget everything but the music.&nbsp; Has Rose any
voice?&nbsp; I must get her to sing to me when you bring her over
next.&nbsp; But you bring her so seldom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be jealous of me, you know,
I&rsquo;m only an old woman.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll be getting
jealous of all the men directly; you won&rsquo;t be able to help
it.&nbsp; Every day she&rsquo;s growing up, you know, and every
day some boy you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of is growing up
too&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know where he is, and Rose
doesn&rsquo;t know, and he&rsquo;s never heard of Rose.&nbsp;
There he is, somewhere, in his little Eton jacket, with big ears
and a snub nose as likely as not, and every minute he&rsquo;s
drawing nearer to Rose and she&rsquo;s drawing nearer to
him.&nbsp; And neither of them knowing a thing about it!&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that terrible?&nbsp; Just Fate arranging everything
and we all out in the cold; and no one so out in the cold as the
parents and guardians!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about yourself,&rdquo; she went on, for she
was remorseless where the relations of the sexes were
concerned.&nbsp; &ldquo;How old are you?&nbsp; Thirty-five, shall
we say?&nbsp; And Rose is seven.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Then when
she&rsquo;s twenty you&rsquo;ll be forty-eight&mdash;the
dangerous age!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the time for you to <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>look out,
Doctor.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll want all your strength of mind then,
because we mustn&rsquo;t marry our wards, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman!&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with facing the facts?&nbsp; If every one would do it
this world would be a sweeter place.&nbsp; But why don&rsquo;t
you marry, anyway?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter with us?&nbsp;
Do you hate us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life is
too full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you lose your pretty Rosy, and then
you&rsquo;ll be feeling the draught,&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, Doctor, Doctor, it&rsquo;s a sad old age you&rsquo;re
building up for yourself; and you don&rsquo;t play cards
either.&nbsp; A sad old age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctors shouldn&rsquo;t have wives any more than actors
should,&rdquo; I would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one should marry
unless he is going to keep some kind of hours; and doctors
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not at least until they&rsquo;re specialists
and receive patients in Harley Street from ten to one; and by
that time they&rsquo;re crystallized fossils.&nbsp; Parsons
should marry&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, conspicuously do
so&mdash;and stockbrokers and lawyers and country squires and
most other people; but not doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just as well for my rheumatism that
your father had different views,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not that you do me any good,&rdquo; she hastened to add,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s comforting to have a doctor about the
place, and you&rsquo;re something to talk to.&nbsp; You listen
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>So she
would run on.</p>
<p>But she did not talk like this when Rose was with her.&nbsp;
She drew then on her memory and fancy for all that was gay and
amusing; brought out old scrap-books; disinterred a musical-box
from the lumber-room; and had an amazing ancient
dolls&rsquo;-house put into thorough repair both inside and
out.&nbsp; Rose was happier with Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman than with
anyone but, I hope, me.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I had, of course, patients in whose houses I should not care
for Rose to be intimate; and it was not easy for me to repel
their friendly advances.&nbsp; But Rose was capable, if she met
them when out walking, of replying to overtures with the firmest
refusals.&nbsp; Child as she was, she knew her own mind, and she
was not old enough or weak enough to have any preoccupation with
the feelings of others.&nbsp; It was not callousness: not at all;
but it was not in her nature to adapt herself&mdash;not yet, nor
would it ever be to any great extent, except for the most serious
reasons.&nbsp; She was in a playground, and her play had so far
always been with congenial spirits: why should it be
otherwise?&nbsp; So she felt.</p>
<p>I had been brought up differently.&nbsp; I had been brought up
to think of others; to spare sensibilities even to the extent of
prevarication; to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; where I would rather have
said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if I thought <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>that &ldquo;No&rdquo; would be more
agreeable to the other person involved: to pass the salt; to be
self-denying.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s father had no such attitude
towards others, nor did he impose it on his daughter.&nbsp; He
had considered the world his orange, and Rose was disposed to do
the same.&nbsp; She had no tendency to be grasping or greedy; she
had that sense of hospitality to which politeness is a corollary;
while her good humour and sense of fun and laughter also made her
naturally a dispenser of happiness.&nbsp; But nothing prevented
her from telling the truth, neither fear nor favour.&nbsp; How I
used to envy her this!</p>
<p>Every teacher must learn something from the taught, I suppose,
though it be only an idea of his own ignorance.&nbsp; And I found
myself learning from Rose all the time.&nbsp; Her simplicities
rebuked my complexities; her innocence disturbed my
sophistication.&nbsp; But most I learned from her not only the
importance of truth-telling in the social system, but the
superior excellence of it in the difficult scheme of civilized
life.&nbsp; By always telling the truth one saves oneself from a
multitude of fatiguing cares.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that Rose
knew this, even subconsciously; she told the truth because it was
in her nature.&nbsp; But it might also have been her
privilege.&nbsp; Of all people, a pretty woman has least reason
to put herself to the trouble of inventions; because she would
always be forgiven.</p>
<p>It was of course too late for me to become truthful
spontaneously, as Rose could be; but <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>under her influence, child as she was
and fully grown man (if any man is ever fully grown) as I was, I
learned to think twice and be truthful on the second
thought.&nbsp; I learned, too, through her unconscious tuition,
that other people&rsquo;s feelings are rarely as delicate as we
fancy them, and often never worth serious consideration; at any
rate, that the health of one&rsquo;s own soul is more important
than the comfort of anyone else.</p>
<p>I speak of myself as a teacher, but I had dispensed no formal
instruction.&nbsp; Whatever Rose got from me was in the ordinary
course of conversation, at breakfast and in the garden and at odd
times, and perhaps particularly at night, when she had gone to
bed and I sat with her for half an hour and, according to Hannah,
excited her little brain.&nbsp; I am sure that I have advised
thousands of parents not to overdo the good-night gossip; but
doctors rarely practise what they preach.</p>
<p>I used to read to her too; and if she had not wanted the same
stories so often we might have consumed hundreds of books
together.&nbsp; Ruskin&rsquo;s &ldquo;King of the Golden
River&rdquo; (does anyone read that now?) was one of her
favourites, and I could not substitute a word in it without being
detected.&nbsp; That legend is, of course, a lesson too.</p>
<p>All that I had to offer was a <i>gradus</i> to life.&nbsp; The
real instructors would come later, with their geography and
history and mathematics and languages and so forth.&nbsp; The
most that I hoped for was that, indirectly, the effect of my
general <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>attitude to things might be that Rose some day would be
able to avoid a few pitfalls.&nbsp; To get positive qualities
into another is more difficult than to implant a certain
caution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you men are all alike!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
felt that if I could make it impossible for Rose ever to say
that, I should have done something far better than to fill her
mind with facts and figures.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among all the trivialities of our life together in those early
days it is difficult to make a selection of saliences.&nbsp; Rose
was not a remarkable child in any way, except perhaps in the lack
of special qualities.&nbsp; She was quiet and self-contained and,
I used to think, very sensible: perhaps her general good sense
was her strongest point.&nbsp; She was not a universal
sympathizer, but where her affections were set she was very
tenacious in her kindnesses and even tendernesses.&nbsp; I
remember an incident which illustrates this characteristic.</p>
<p>We had at that time a dog named Rex, a Clumber spaniel, which
all too seldom I took out shooting.&nbsp; He was called mine, but
in reality was Rose&rsquo;s, fixing himself to her like a shadow,
and being miserable when she was out and he had not been allowed
to go too.</p>
<p>Well, one evening at the time when Rose took out his great
dish of broken victuals, Rex was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; He
had never strayed before, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and we had no cheering theory to
propound to the child to account for his conduct.&nbsp; Other
theories we kept to ourselves, such as the possibility of a thief
having enticed Rex away, or that he had followed a hare into
preserved ground and had got into a trap, or even had been
shot.&nbsp; A new keeper on one of the neighbouring estates had
been heard to vow extermination to any dog that he caught
trespassing.</p>
<p>No one allowed Rose to hear conjectures of this kind, but we
all rather obviously shared her anxiety, and she was able to see
through our forced airs of assurance.</p>
<p>The hours went on, and still no Rex.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s
bed-time came and was long passed, but she would not consent to
leave the hall door.&nbsp; There she stood, now and then calling,
with the dish of food beside her.</p>
<p>Hannah was furious, but to no purpose.&nbsp; Dogs to her were
just dogs&mdash;four-footed creatures, useful to bark at night
and protect the house, but given to importing mud into houses and
not blameless as to the encouragement of fleas.&nbsp; Many a
conflict have we had, she and I, over Rex&rsquo;s charter to roam
where he would, upstairs or down.&nbsp; On this occasion we came
to a wider cleavage than ever, for Hannah (and, from her point of
view, very rightly) wished Rose to go to bed, whereas I, although
conscious that as a habit such vigils would be very bad for her,
was inclined to accede to her tearful wishes and allow her on
this occasion to wait up.&nbsp; Such <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>evidences of solicitude for her dog
were very gratifying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to bed, Dombeen, until I know,&rdquo;
she said, and she had my sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall stay up,&rdquo; I assured her,
&ldquo;till&mdash;till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till he comes back?&rdquo; she supplied eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, he may have been found wandering by some one who
has tied him up till the morning and will then bring him
home.&nbsp; And you couldn&rsquo;t wait up till then, could
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I could,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well even if you could, I couldn&rsquo;t let
you,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you shall stay up
till&mdash;till midnight, say.&nbsp; Till the clock strikes
twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, later than that,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I wait till three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We compromised upon half-past one, and Hannah&rsquo;s opinion
of me sank still lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calls himself a doctor!&rdquo; I fancy I heard her
muttering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his devotion, old Wellicum was scouring the
neighbourhood in one direction, and Briggs in another, and the
stable-boy in a third.</p>
<p>They straggled back at about midnight, and at half-past one I
moved the closure and we all went to bed, fearing the worst.</p>
<p>It was just three when I was awakened by a furious knocking at
the door and a joyous voice crying, &ldquo;Dombeen, Dombeen,
he&rsquo;s come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>And so
he had, the rascal, after what we discovered later to have been
simply a distant amatory expedition.</p>
<p>Rose, it seems, although she had consented to go to bed, had
got up again and had been sitting by the window until she had
seen love&rsquo;s pilgrim creep in.</p>
<p>Downstairs we went, in our dressing-gowns, and fed him and
petted him as though he were a hero instead of a mere
voluptuary.&nbsp; What kind of a welcome Rex had expected, and
what he thought of the surprising turn that things had taken and
our manifestations of delight, I can only guess, but being a
Clumber he probably laughed long when at last he regained his
kennel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was when Rose was ten or eleven that the Hall, the big
house of the place, with a park around it, was bought by Sir
Edmund Fergusson, and local society was enriched by the addition
of his family, which consisted of Lady Fergusson and their only
child, Ronald, or Ronnie, who was about Rose&rsquo;s own age.</p>
<p>The Fergussons naturally became my patients.&nbsp; Sir
Edmund&rsquo;s trouble was gout, which, like most gouty people,
he did nothing consistently to check.&nbsp; Sporadically he was
careful in his diet, but then would arrive a temptation that he
could not resist.&nbsp; A large part of all doctors&rsquo; lives
is taken up in <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>scolding gouty patients for their imprudences and
patching them up into a condition to commit more.</p>
<p>Ronnie Fergusson had a tutor at that time, and Rose a
governess; and neither instructor was inclined to extend the
working hours unreasonably.&nbsp; During the playing hours the
two children were much together.&nbsp; They had a crow&rsquo;s
nest in one of the Fergussons&rsquo; trees, and an empty
furnace-pit under a disused greenhouse of mine served them as a
robbers&rsquo; cave.</p>
<p>Ronnie&rsquo;s parents having married late, he was more like
their grandson than son, and therefore a little lonely, and
Rose&rsquo;s companionship was exactly what his nature
needed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Until Rose was thirteen I knew nothing but serenity in my
foster-fatherhood.&nbsp; But then she gave me a shock.&nbsp; It
turned out to be a false alarm in that it set up no precedent,
but for a while I was nervous.</p>
<p>I had decided to send her to school.&nbsp; Were my own
pleasure the only consideration I should have kept her at home,
but a girl ought to be among others, to learn give-and-take,
adjustment, and so forth.&nbsp; Thirteen was late, of course, but
she was not quite like other girls&mdash;an only child is always
a little different&mdash;and the lateness did not matter.</p>
<p>In practical matters she already knew more than any of her
teachers could tell her.&nbsp; She knew a <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>good deal
about medicine and the care of invalids, derived principally from
Hannah, but a little from me; she had presided at the tea-table
for years and prepared the infusion like a Chinese philosopher;
she could make an omelette.&nbsp; She had a considerable store of
Norman patois.&nbsp; She had countless books, many of them far
beyond her years.&nbsp; It would probably have been better if she
continued to remain at home; but she was too normal to be denied
ordinary procedure, or I was too normal to have the courage to
deny it her.</p>
<p>After many fruitless inquiries and inconvenient visits, I had
allowed Mrs. Stratton to find Rose a school.&nbsp; It was at
Brighton, where more young people seem to be taught than, judging
by the passivity of the fishermen on the railings, fish are drawn
from the sea; and I was assured that there was no more admirable
establishment, and that Miss Saltoun was the last word in
sympathetic and cultured head-mistress-ship.&nbsp; I went to see
her and was more or less satisfied.&nbsp; Not wholly; but having
had no experience as a selector of educationalists, I let it go,
especially as I was more than pleased with the material
conditions of the building&mdash;light, air, and so forth.</p>
<p>Rose and I had a silent breakfast on the fatal day.&nbsp; She
had been looking forward to it with mixed feelings, sometimes
glad to be joining such a company of girls after so much
isolation, sometimes forlorn indeed at the thought of leaving her
home.&nbsp; On the last evening she had broken down <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>completely;
but in the morning she wore an expression of grim resolution,
which I admired too much to run the risk of dissolving it by
talking about any unsafe subject; and no subject seeming to be
safe, I said nothing.</p>
<p>Her farewell to the household was tearful; but she pulled
herself together to part bravely from me, and then she and Hannah
drove off.&nbsp; It was a double breaking up of tradition; for
Hannah, after taking her to Paddington and putting her into the
hands of Mrs. Stratton, who would convoy her to Victoria, where
there were reserved compartments for the school, was to go on to
her home at Lowestoft, alas! for ever.&nbsp; She had been growing
more infirm and could no longer manage the stairs, and when Rose
came back for the holidays there was to be a new maid for her,
instead of our old friend.&nbsp; It was part of the new programme
that Rose was to be generally more self-reliant.</p>
<p>More self-reliant!</p>
<p>It was on a Tuesday that Rose departed.&nbsp; Just as I was
finishing my soup on the following Thursday evening, who should
walk in but Rose and fling herself on her knees beside me and
shake with sobs?</p>
<p>There she knelt, with my hand on her head trying to allay the
storm, for minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Dombeen!&rdquo; she managed at last to say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay there.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;horrid.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t like me to stay there.&nbsp; Really you
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The
fact that I didn&rsquo;t ask her to explain, that I took it for
granted that she was right, will indicate at once the kind of
fatalist that I was, and our sub-conscious terms of
understanding.</p>
<p>Rose was tired out&mdash;too tired to eat&mdash;and I am
afraid that in the absence of Hannah, whose loss was a terrible
disappointment&mdash;for although Rose had known of it she had
not fully realized it&mdash;she cried herself to sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to have had much of a night&rsquo;s rest
myself, for such a false start as this was no part of the
educational programme.&nbsp; Theodore&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;bring
her up to beat the band&rdquo;&mdash;rang in my ears.</p>
<p>Was this beating the band?&nbsp; On the face of it, no.&nbsp;
We must not run away.&nbsp; And yet (I argued) to run away often
implies more character than to endure, and surely that was
Rose&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; She was not a coward, she was not
self-indulgent; that I knew.&nbsp; Nor did she imagine
things.&nbsp; Child as she was, I trusted her judgment and
accepted the position.&nbsp; The school was horrid, and she
couldn&rsquo;t stay there; that was enough.&nbsp; I knew her
sufficiently well to be sure that she would have put up with it
if she had believed that any good could result; but she knew the
reverse and she had acted accordingly.&nbsp; She had walked out
of the house, found her way to the station, and the pocket-money
I had given her and her own resourcefulness had done the
rest.</p>
<p>The next morning I had a very pale and demure companion at
breakfast.&nbsp; She also had evidently <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>been
thinking, and had seen that thus to take the law into her own
hands was a proceeding of considerable magnitude&mdash;such
magnitude that she looked dwarfed under it.&nbsp; But although
subdued and <i>pianissimo</i>, there was no sign of weakness on
her features.&nbsp; It may have been a gigantic effort of
independence, but she did not regret it.</p>
<p>I had sent to Brighton a reassuring telegram (crossing one
from Osborne House) on the previous evening, and on the arrival
of a second telegram from Miss Saltoun saying that she was on her
way to see me, I dispatched Rose to Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s
for the day, with an explanatory note.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards a very indignant Miss Saltoun arrived for
an interview.&nbsp; Her idea no doubt was to take Rose back with
her; but I had no intention of permitting that.&nbsp; I did not
even let them meet, to Miss Saltoun&rsquo;s intense
surprise.&nbsp; Should she be still alive, I doubt if her
eyebrows have yet resumed their normal level, to such an altitude
did she lift them when I announced my decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is fatal to let a child behave like this,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the end of all discipline.&nbsp;
What would come to the world if no one were punished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that Rose would not lack punishment.&nbsp; Her shame in
not being able to remain at Brighton was punishment.&nbsp; She
was not proud of herself at all, I said, even though she
couldn&rsquo;t do anything else but run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose every child ran away!&rdquo; said Miss
Saltoun.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would the world come to!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;It would probably be very good for the
world,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because only children with
character have the pluck to take such a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has ever run away from Osborne House
before,&rdquo; said Miss Saltoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And probably no one ever will again,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very damaging to me,&rdquo; she protested,
&ldquo;if it gets to be known, as of course it must do.&nbsp; Of
what did Rose complain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that I hadn&rsquo;t asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not asked her!&rdquo; Miss Saltoun exclaimed.&nbsp; And
I could see her swiftly putting two and two together and
realizing that it was my deplorable indulgence that was at the
back of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She merely said that
she could not stay and had therefore come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you allow that?&nbsp; Condone that?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too amazing!&nbsp; Is every caprice of a child like
this to satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is capricious,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I agree with you that the occurrence is
unfortunate.&nbsp; I wish it had never been.&nbsp; I wish Rose
had not gone to school at all, anywhere.&nbsp; But I would much
rather&mdash;even at the risk of being unfair to you&mdash;that
she were not interrogated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Saltoun kept her temper under fair control, but she could
not help indicating that she was glad that all her pupils had not
such impossible parents or foster-parents, and that on the whole
she was of the opinion that she was well out of it.</p>
<p>Nor did I feel particularly pleased with the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>position I
had been forced to take up.&nbsp; It was not too civil, and I
doubt if it was just to the schoolmistress.&nbsp; But Rose was my
first consideration, and I knew with crystal clearness that no
possible good to either could come out of a cross-examination of
her by Miss Saltoun.&nbsp; Miss Saltoun would have been hostile
and suspicious, utterly incapable of understanding the
child&rsquo;s fundamental honesty and courage, nor would she have
had any belief that a child&rsquo;s antipathies, a child&rsquo;s
dislike of Dr. Fell, need not be less sincere or important than
an adult&rsquo;s.&nbsp; To her, children were immature beings to
be taught deportment and the length of rivers; to me, Rose was an
individual, separate and complete, with private sensitivenesses
and loyalties that must not be harmed.</p>
<p>Miss Saltoun caught her train, and I drove over to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman to fetch Rose back.&nbsp; I had sent her there for
the day, to be out of the way and also to be in the company of
the most sensible woman I knew.</p>
<p>I found them turning over old volumes of &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo;
and having sent Rose off to help Julia in some capacity or other,
Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman turned to me with a smile on her mischievous
old face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be proud of yourself,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have brought her up so well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
mean what you&rsquo;ve taught her, but to have left so much
resolution in her.&nbsp; Most people knock it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;More chance than design,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, she&rsquo;s got it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman, &ldquo;and if she always obeys impulse and cuts
her losses so promptly she won&rsquo;t go far wrong.&nbsp; Her
heart&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she wants to go to
school.&nbsp; When I say &lsquo;wants&rsquo; I mean something
very different; I mean she&rsquo;s willing to go to school and
she knows she ought to go to school.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t
think, and she won&rsquo;t admit (you see I&rsquo;ve been testing
her) she did wrong to run away from this one&mdash;and I agree
with her&mdash;but she knows that if she stayed at home now it
would be a victory wrongly won.&nbsp; And she doesn&rsquo;t want
to do anything unfair, bless her! although, of course,
she&rsquo;ll have to before she&rsquo;s through.&nbsp; The world
will see to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What school?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman, &ldquo;but, this time, for the love of God find
it yourself.&nbsp; How you came to let that Stratton woman pick
out the other for you I shall never understand.&nbsp; And you
more or less a sensible fellow too!&nbsp; But there, we&rsquo;ve
all got our blind spots.&nbsp; Even I can&rsquo;t bring myself to
change my medical adviser.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At her next school Rose was happy and did well.</p>
<p>While she was away, I gave more time to an <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>old toy of
mine&mdash;the microscope&mdash;and was gradually, I doubt not,
becoming a fossil.&nbsp; I was beginning also to supplement the
collection of prints which my father had left, and buying
experience rather dearly.&nbsp; Between the holidays these were
my indoor hobbies, while there was always the garden for such
daylight hours as my patients left me.&nbsp; Now and then I dined
out, at the Hall or the Rectory or with Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman; and
so the time wore on.&nbsp; To be creatures of habit seems to be
our destiny, and if we are to escape we must continually
fight.&nbsp; Personally, I did not fight.&nbsp; I was counting on
Rose to be my deliverer when, at the end of her last school term,
she returned to galvanize her old foster-father and keep him gay
once more.</p>
<p>Every time Rose came home, three times a year, I saw a change
in her, but it was not until the winter holidays when she was
nearly sixteen that I suddenly realized that she had grown into a
beautiful creature, capable of setting men&rsquo;s hearts
beating, and of disturbing lives and affecting destinies.&nbsp;
Not, of course, that one has to be beautiful to affect destiny:
we can all do that, and all are doing it continually.&nbsp; But
pretty women appear to be busier than other persons, even if they
are not.</p>
<p>There had been a week of clear skies and pure sunshine, and an
east wind blowing with sufficient nippiness to keep the ice
hard.&nbsp; Rose had been skating every day with various
neighbours, and <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>she and two or three young fellows were now walking up
the drive jangling their skates and laughing.&nbsp; Her high
gaiters made her look unusually tall, and she came along with her
easy long stride like a conqueror, her face glowing under the
frost and her eyes alight with merriment.&nbsp; She wore a fur
cap and a fur jacket with a high collar, and you know what furs
can do for even a plain woman.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s vivid animation
was almost fire; but what struck me most was a new confidence,
unconscious but visible, and the deference and competitive
eagerness which were expressed in her companions.&nbsp; When I
had seen her last, at lunch, she had been a girl; now, only three
hours later, she was an influence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest that from that moment her life was more
mature; I don&rsquo;t think that with any steadiness it was; but
the dominant woman had flashed out for a moment, and I never
forgot the apparition.</p>
<p>In those days, although Rose had several boy satellites, who
seemed to me, with not too numerous opportunities of observing
them closely, to be on terms of a very simple natural intimacy
with her, chief of them was still Ronnie Fergusson.&nbsp; He was
her most constant companion, dropping in oftener than the others,
and taking her on longer expeditions or more frequently joining
in our games at home, whether indoors or out.&nbsp; Although I
was in the forties I was active on the tennis lawn, and at
billiards I could beat anyone in the <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>neighbourhood.&nbsp; I had been
coaching Rose and finding her a much better pupil than I ever
expected: perhaps the vanity in her stimulated her to try the
harder, for there were mirrors at each end of the room in which
she could see herself, and there is hardly a stroke in the game
which does not emphasize the beauty of arms and hands.&nbsp;
Ronnie was a billiard enthusiast too, but I kept Rose ahead of
him, and they became very keen combatants.&nbsp; He was at my
house after dinner on most evenings during the holidays.</p>
<p>Ronnie&rsquo;s parents we did not much care for.&nbsp; Sir
Edmund Fergusson, who was now retired, had been a northern
manufacturer and mayor: a roughish <i>nouveau-riche</i>, with a
great desire to assimilate county manners and play as naturally
as possible his new role of squire.&nbsp; Lady Fergusson was an
ordinary motherly woman, with a good deal of pride in her husband
and a touch of the snob.&nbsp; Both adored their son, but whereas
Lady Fergusson showed her feelings, Sir Edmund disguised his.</p>
<p>Ronnie, although not to that status born, had become a typical
English public-school boy with an easy manner, a delight in fun
and a merry hair-trigger laugh.&nbsp; Good to look at too, with
his fair hair and lightly-tanned skin and very white teeth.&nbsp;
He did not suggest any great force of character: his blunt little
nose was against that; but he seemed to be an epitome of
affection and good humour, and was likely to succeed in the world
by reason of an inherent popularity.&nbsp; The <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>kind of boy
and man that others who might reasonably be envious would go out
of their way to serve, just to have a smile of gratitude and to
enjoy the sensation of having benefited a persuasive
creature.&nbsp; However rich Ronnie might become he would receive
more; because of those who have, and to whom therefore is given,
he was among the most attractive.</p>
<p>The world is a strange place; and why some of us are born so
that we may not look over a hedge, while others may steal a whole
remount camp and escape censure, no one will ever
understand.&nbsp; But Ronnie was high among the immune
horse-thieves.</p>
<p>He did things well, too.&nbsp; He played games well and looked
his best in flannels.&nbsp; Our village cricket team, which
languished through the early weeks of the season and was too
often beaten, rallied when Ronnie came home for the holidays and
had its sweet revenge in the return matches.&nbsp; If Rose was
still defeating him at billiards it was because her tactics were
better.&nbsp; She had more strategy.</p>
<p>The Ronnies of the world usually marry young and go fairly
happily through their wedded life.&nbsp; This perhaps is because
their attraction is neither for very clever women nor for
decadents, but for the jolly.&nbsp; The sporting,
adventurous&mdash;I might almost say picnic&mdash;element in
young people&rsquo;s marriages lasts with these longer than with
more serious or more brilliant or more passionate couples.</p>
<p>There was, however, no outward sign of <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>anything
deeper than the best good-fellowship between Ronnie and
Rose.&nbsp; They liked and laughed, and handed each other the
half-butt, and there it remained.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But a year later there were developments.</p>
<p>England is no country for the skating enthusiast, and Rose
continually mentioned her desire to spend the following Christmas
holidays&mdash;her last&mdash;at one of the winter-sport centres
in Switzerland.&nbsp; To be away at that time of year, when
maladies are most flourishing, was no easy or prudent course for
me; but Rose was set upon it, and one can always get a locum
tenens if one really wants to, and I had not played truant for a
long while, and might be all the better for it after; and so I
agreed.</p>
<p>The next thing was&mdash;Ronnie must come too.&nbsp; Ronnie,
who was now at Sandhurst, was far more eager to spend his
holidays with us than at the Hall; and the dream of his life was
to be in some place where you could count on the frost lasting
till to-morrow.&nbsp; It is always a mystery to me how in our
island, with the Gulf Stream persistently paying attentions to
it, anyone learns to skate at all.&nbsp; Ronnie, however, had had
the chance to become a good skater, and he longed to be better
and to do some skiing and bob-sleighing too.&nbsp; Rose shared
his enthusiasm.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>I must
admit to feeling doubtful as to whether it was the wisest thing
to take a boy of eighteen and a girl of seventeen to Switzerland
in this way; but the fact that their minds were so exclusively
set on open-air activities reassured me.&nbsp; And the Fergussons
made no objections, beyond expressing the regret that their only
son should wish to be away for Christmas.</p>
<p>None the less I carried the matter to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s tribunal; for when in doubt I invariably
adopted that procedure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them?&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;ll take
them,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or rather, they&rsquo;ll take
you.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s high time you got away from this mouldy
corner and allowed some mountain air to get into your fusty old
brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so fusty?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is.&nbsp; How can it be anything else,
considering the life you lead?&nbsp; Sitting by the bedsides of
bores; prescribing physic; talking weather; pottering about
within a radius of five miles when there&rsquo;s the whole big
world waiting for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no great opinion of you,
as you know, but you&rsquo;ve got the best brains in the
place&mdash;London brains, in short&mdash;and you do nothing with
them.&nbsp; Perhaps when you see Mont Blanc you&rsquo;ll get a
little ambition.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to leave us, but I
want you to do something besides patching up our
twopenny-halfpenny bodies.&nbsp; Write a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed aloud at this.&nbsp; How little did I foresee!</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;Very well, then; make some scientific
investigations; anything to justify your gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is it wise for Rose
and Ronnie to be thrown together as they will be on this
trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, is it wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by wise.&nbsp; Do you
mean, will it increase their inclination to fall in
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I suppose I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be so unwise?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it would,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rather it didn&rsquo;t happen
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going
to happen, it&rsquo;s going to happen, no matter what you
do.&nbsp; And if it isn&rsquo;t, your taking them to Switzerland
won&rsquo;t make any difference.&nbsp; Both of them are rapidly
reaching an age when no one can protect them.&nbsp; Nature will
be in charge; not parents or Dr. Grevilles.&nbsp; Switzerland,
wherever you go, will be full of young people, and they&rsquo;ll
both make friends, and very likely they&rsquo;ll lose their
hearts too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out of your hands.&nbsp; Supposing
you don&rsquo;t go, it will be just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acquiesced.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All went well for a few days.&nbsp; And then Ronnie, against
my counsel, and also against Rose&rsquo;s, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>which usually
prevailed, joined a party on a bobsleigh, and was carried into
the hotel, an hour later, with a fractured leg and a vast variety
of bruises.&nbsp; I let the Fergussons know, assuring them that
there was no danger, and together Rose and I, with the assistance
of a nurse, got him through.&nbsp; He was fairly patient, but his
disappointment was acute, and now and then under his weakness he
broke down.&nbsp; More than once I went into the room to find
Rose soothing him as though he were a baby.&nbsp; All his
dependence came out, to be met by all her tenderness.&nbsp; I had
not thought she possessed such hidden stores of it.</p>
<p>I must confess to feeling miserably out in the cold most of
the time, for Ronnie, though he was as gay as possible with me,
and brave enough under the pain that his dressings inflicted, was
happy only with Rose, and I could not fail to see it.&nbsp; And
he exacted far too much attention from her.&nbsp; I hardly had
any of her company.&nbsp; She could not do this or that because
Ronnie might want her; Ronnie would be lonely; she had promised
Ronnie to read to him; she had sworn that when he woke up, no
matter at what time, he should find her beside him.&nbsp; I
admired her sense of duty&mdash;and resented it too!</p>
<p>After a fortnight the Fergussons joined us, to supervise their
son&rsquo;s recovery, and Rose and I went home, for she had her
school and I my practice; but I was conscious that not all of her
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>was with
me in the train; and Ronnie&rsquo;s parting from her, I realised,
had been too emotional.&nbsp; Suddenly he had kissed her as
though his heart was breaking, and she had almost to be torn
away.</p>
<p>I have seen so many sick men under the influence of gratitude
to their nurses that I did not lay very much stress on this
incident; but I could not forget it.&nbsp; I wished, however,
that Rose should, and during the journey back I did all that I
could to distract her.&nbsp; She was very quiet at first, but
gradually became more like herself, and by the time we reached
home and she began to prepare for school she seemed usually, at
any rate when with me, natural again and free from care.&nbsp;
But away from me?&nbsp; And when she was day-dreaming?&nbsp; It
was at these times that I realized again and bitterly how finite
is our understanding of each other.&nbsp; We live alone!&nbsp; I
would have given anything to be able to penetrate her thoughts,
and help.&nbsp; But I could not.</p>
<p>Was she in love or merely reflective?&nbsp; Was she looking
back or forward?&nbsp; I longed to know, but could not ask.</p>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman cheered me up.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
likely it&rsquo;s nothing at all,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just a passing storm, even if that.&nbsp; Very few of the
romances of seventeen persist.&nbsp; I was like that myself: my
heart was broken a dozen times before I was Rose&rsquo;s age, and
at eighteen I seriously meditated suicide because my violin
teacher was married.&nbsp; It was in Dublin.&nbsp; I remember to
this hour the <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>smell of the Liffey that came up to me as I leaned over
Carlisle Bridge one evening coming back from a lesson, and
pretended I wanted to drown myself and all my grief.&nbsp; No one
could have entered such water as that!&nbsp; And ten days later I
had forgotten all about the fiddler, and was inventing a novel
with me the heroine and the hero an actor at the theatre that
week, who didn&rsquo;t even know of my existence.&nbsp; Maybe
Rose will be like that.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose had only two more terms, and as she spent most of the
Easter holidays with a school-fellow, she did not meet
Ronnie.&nbsp; During the few days she was with me she seemed to
be heart-whole; certainly there was no suggestion of blighted
affection, for her spirits were of the highest.&nbsp; So Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman, I assumed, was right again.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was just before Rose&rsquo;s return from school for ever,
in the summer, that I had an unexpected visit from Mrs. Stratton,
in the character of the solicitous aunt.&nbsp; She arrived in the
forenoon, and while doing justice to lunch unfolded her
purpose.&nbsp; Briefly it was to renew the attack begun eleven
years earlier, only now with perhaps more reasonableness.</p>
<p>My unpardonable offence was still the same&mdash;celibacy, but
it had assumed an increased gravity.&nbsp; To be a bachelor of
thirty-four in charge of a <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>child of seven was deplorable enough;
but to be a bachelor of forty-five in charge of a girl of
eighteen was heinous.&nbsp; It was thus that her nasty mind
worked.&nbsp; And not only hers but, she assured me, countless
other persons&rsquo;.&nbsp; In fact, I gathered from her remarks
that the unsuitability of my household was the only theme with
which, in a few days&rsquo; time, the world would be
occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morbid interest in my affairs is very
disgusting,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton admitted it; but how could I deny that some
handle was being given?&nbsp; &ldquo;You two alone
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do deny it, absolutely,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you all know the conditions of the will?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you know that Rose is in my care until she is
twenty&mdash;that is to say, for two more years&mdash;entrusted
to me by her father, to act as a father in his place?&nbsp; It is
monstrous to suggest that I am not worthy of that
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not suggesting that,&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton
replied indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mere
fact that you come here and put these ideas into my head is
tantamount to a charge, an indictment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you mean it or not: the
effect is the same.&nbsp; By bringing your indecent suspicions
here you are hoping to make it impossible for me any more to be
natural with this girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me if I
speak with plainness, but I feel strongly about it.&nbsp; It is
abominable.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe that decent living and
pure affection are possible in this world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they are, but I am troubled about my
niece&rsquo;s&mdash;my brother&rsquo;s only
child&rsquo;s&mdash;good name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked her sarcastically for the compliment.&nbsp; I was
conscious that I was being rude, but I could not control
myself.&nbsp; There are some persons who always draw out our
inferior qualities, just as the companionship of others can
increase the value of our character by fifty per cent.&nbsp; Mrs.
Stratton invariably evoked my worst side.&nbsp; Any fine edge
that I possessed was blunted when we were together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is what people may think and say that is so
disturbing to me,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know how
they talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am learning,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But anyone
over thirty-five should have acquired an indifference to public
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a counsel of perfection,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;In ordinary life we are all governed by it,
or at any rate we are largely influenced.&nbsp; It would be
heart-breaking to me if I thought that people were saying horrid
things about Rose and you.&nbsp; Mind, I don&rsquo;t say that
they are talking already,&rdquo; she conceded.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
they&rsquo;ll begin very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say with any definiteness.&nbsp; How
could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I want to know.&nbsp; It is
your business to tell me.&nbsp; Rose comes back on
Wednesday.&nbsp; Will they begin on Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re being absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
know.&nbsp; I must arrange things.&nbsp; Will they begin on
Friday?&nbsp; Remember&mdash;a girl of eighteen!&mdash;eighteen
is just the age for these people to gloat over: eighteen and
forty-five, what a titbit for you all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mix me up in this,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Stratton indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
titbit for every one else!&nbsp; But, anyhow, remember that this
girl of eighteen will have been alone in her guardian&rsquo;s
house two whole days by Friday, with nothing but the maids and
whatever good character he may have built up for himself to
protect her.&nbsp; May I safely take no steps till
Friday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton was becoming very cross.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being ridiculous,&rdquo; she snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Logical
merely.&nbsp; Very well then,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
we may have two days, why not three?&nbsp; And if three days and
there is no public clamour, and the windows are not broken by the
Association for Getting Morality into Others or the Society for
Suspecting Every One Else, perhaps we could have a week of
innocent companionship, Rose and I?&nbsp; I have not <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>unnaturally
been looking forward to it.&nbsp; And if one week, why not
two?&nbsp; Surely you must see that I am entitled to know
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you never married,&rdquo; was
her reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how much wiser that
would have been?&nbsp; Everything would have been
simplified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose and I have got on very well alone,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how much nicer for Rose to have had a woman&rsquo;s
guidance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;On all questions
touching life, worldly education and so forth, a man can be as
instructive; and in so far as protectiveness goes he can be as
tender and as thorough.&nbsp; What remains girls get by
instinct.&nbsp; And Rose likes me: that&rsquo;s another great
asset.&nbsp; Supposing that she did not like my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s being too fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&nbsp; Supposing that my wife
didn&rsquo;t like Rose?&nbsp; Women can be very disapproving of
each other&mdash;very jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this doesn&rsquo;t affect the main thing,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am still worried by the
extreme impropriety of you and my niece living here
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what you
propose&mdash;for you must have some proposition in your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose could come to us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are planning to go to the Italian Riviera for the
winter&mdash;to Nervi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But on returning,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there would be
the same opportunities for calumny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;Might it not be possible to have a companion for
her?&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some nice woman to
live here?&nbsp; I know of one I could recommend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, not without emphasis, &ldquo;it
might not, I will not have any nice woman here.&nbsp; Besides, if
I did, what would be the result?&nbsp; Simply more
suspicions!&nbsp; I should be thought bigamous instead of merely
monogamous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; said Mrs. Stratton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I meant
an elderly woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. Stratton&rsquo;s visit was disturbing.&nbsp; I had been
looking forward to two years of Rose&rsquo;s company before the
time arrived when she was twenty and would probably want to be
independent, and I thought I was entitled to it.&nbsp; These two
years were to be very precious&mdash;a kind of reward, if you
like, for my foster-parental solicitude; and now they were
threatened.</p>
<p>It was not public opinion that I was fearing, but the
self-conscious restrictions that were being forced on me to the
ruin of easy natural familiarity.&nbsp; I should always now be
wondering if this or that excursion were wise, or what
constructions the beastly world would be putting on this or that
occurrence.&nbsp; Nothing could be simple and unselfconscious any
more!</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>I took
the problem to Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say that this comes as a
surprise to you?&rdquo; she asked, when I had finished the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it did,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O the poor innocent!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And for a doctor too!&nbsp; And haven&rsquo;t I been
telling you about it, for years, here in this very room where
we&rsquo;re sitting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
thought.&nbsp; I was thinking of Rose as a schoolgirl still, not
a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All girls are women,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difference between
girls and boys.&nbsp; Boys go on being boys long after
they&rsquo;re men; girls can be women from birth.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s be practical now.&nbsp; What are the alternatives, do
you say&mdash;Rose to visit about, or a duenna to be
imported?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be no other,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman laughed her triumphant knowing Irish
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is at least one more,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Supposing Rose should become
engaged&mdash;then no one would have anything to say.&nbsp; Many
girls are married and mothers when they&rsquo;re no older than
she is now.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re frowning, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what I was wanting,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made you jealous,&rdquo; she went on
maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I be jealous when I&rsquo;m not in love with
her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;Listen to the man!&rdquo; she mocked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As if jealousy had any logic, any rules or reason!&nbsp;
Every one&rsquo;s jealous&mdash;not only lovers.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
one of the impulses of life; it&rsquo;s a part of all kinds of
honourable respectable emotions that every one praises, such as
ambition.&nbsp; Possessiveness always leads to it&mdash;and that
is why you&rsquo;d hate Rose&rsquo;s lover so, because he&rsquo;d
be taking her away from you: first her thoughts, and then
herself.&nbsp; So should I be jealous if you spent more time
talking with that nincompoop, Mrs. Galloway, than with me.&nbsp;
Jealousy runs through life.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s elemental.&nbsp;
Listen to your spaniel growling when you&rsquo;re patting my
Peek.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use being ashamed of jealousy, and
it&rsquo;s no use believing people when they say they are
superior to the feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us leave it
at that: if Rose became engaged I should be jealous.&nbsp;
Horribly jealous.&nbsp; I admit it.&nbsp; Disappointed,
frustrated, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve hardly seen her yet, and some
fellow carries her off just when she&rsquo;s of age to be a
companion.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.&nbsp; &ldquo;No sense in it whatever.&nbsp; Just
a stupid hurrying along to the tomb.&nbsp; No time to do
anything, except to say, at intervals, &lsquo;Good Heavens! what
have I been doing with my time!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
anyway, let you and me be practical at the moment.&nbsp; There
are three possible courses: One&mdash;that Rose may <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>become
engaged and then Mrs. Stratton and all her friends would cease to
think of you as an immoral man.&nbsp; Two&mdash;that you should
invite some elderly spinster or widow to live in your house as a
perpetual chaperon.&nbsp; And three&mdash;&rdquo; she paused
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; she resumed: &ldquo;that you should go on
as you are and tell them all to go to the devil.&nbsp; All my
votes are for number three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine too,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course the first may happen&mdash;don&rsquo;t
forget that,&rdquo; she warned me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait till it does,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you for your sympathy and counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she called after me, with a rather sinister chuckle.</p>
<p>The warning brought back all my misgivings, and as I walked
home I knew perfectly well that the happiest years were behind me
and that, to a large extent, my Rose was no more.&nbsp; I had
lost her.&nbsp; Even if Mrs. Stratton proved to be wrong and the
world did not talk, I had lost her.&nbsp; For the reason that we
should be living an unnatural life.&nbsp; A lonely girl of
eighteen has too little in common with a man of forty-five whose
attitude to her is parental.&nbsp; It is not such as he that she
would choose for a companion.&nbsp; Being normal, she would
choose a younger man, nearer her both in age and aspirations:
some one to commit, if necessary, follies with; not an old
buffer.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>This
point of division comes in every family, but it can be less
poignant with real parents.&nbsp; At any rate, a real father
would have no such temptation as could assail me, and might have
assailed me had I not always thought so naturally of myself as
Theodore&rsquo;s deputy, his chosen nominee to bring his daughter
up and cherish her; to make her (his phrase was always coming
back to me) &ldquo;beat the band.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would Rose beat
the band?&nbsp; Had I been worthy?&nbsp; Can any child be
depended upon to react to tuition?&nbsp; Impossible to count on
it: the guardian at most can do his best and hope for the
best.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had not much to reproach myself with; but I now saw
that the real testing-time was on us.&nbsp; The real
breaking-point too, for every day Rose, as she ripened and
matured and became more conscious of adult things, would be
growing towards her own life, her own mate, and consequently away
from my life and me.&nbsp; Once again I realized how like ashes
in the mouth the fruits of parenthood can be.&nbsp; The new
generation is always receding from the old; the old pathetically
trying to catch up and understand.&nbsp; The metaphor of a stream
rushing between the two occurred to me: almost none able to swim
and so few bridges!</p>
<p>Once again I realized how pitiless life is, in its unresting
urgency: moving ever on and on, no matter from what contentment,
from what joy: the next moment always more important than this
one!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Rose
came back a woman grown.&nbsp; Not short, not tall&mdash;the
right height&mdash;and to my eyes so sweet, so desirable, that I
could not understand how any young man could fail to succumb, and
I dreaded the time when Ronnie and she would meet.</p>
<p>But I need not have done so, for when that moment arrived it
was not fraught with passion; indeed, they seemed a little
constrained, Ronnie in particular, and it was not until two or
three days had passed that the shyness wore off.&nbsp; Whatever
Ronnie may have felt, he did not seek Rose&rsquo;s society
unduly.</p>
<p>I had proof that, so far as Rose was concerned, there was
nothing serious, a little while after, when, regardless of Mrs.
Stratton&rsquo;s nastiness, we had settled down to a very
delightful routine <i>&agrave; deux</i>.&nbsp; During one of our
talks Rose was frank about her plan of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dombeen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to leave you before I must, but I want to marry
some day; I think every girl who is healthy ought to, and have
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped and looked into an unfathomable distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
girls.&nbsp; I should love to have a boy in the Navy, and see him
in his bright buttons, with sun-burned hair, and freckles.&nbsp;
But it would have to be the right man, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a man would that be?&rdquo; I asked, a
little wistfully, I fear.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unhappy,&rdquo; Rose said, with
one of her gay smiles and a touch on my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t be yet, anyway.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have lots more good
times together before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He may
be just round the corner at this moment.&nbsp; In any case I
should like to know what kind of man you are thinking of.&nbsp; I
might&rdquo;&mdash;here I made an effort to laugh
lightly&mdash;&ldquo;I might be able to find him for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want him
to be your own age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty nearly,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
have fun as well.&nbsp; Older men are rather nice, I know, but
they&rsquo;re rather grave too.&nbsp; I should hate to be tied to
a stodge.&nbsp; Some one who could go long walks, and climb a
tree if necessary, and ride, and be silly at parties.&nbsp; But
not really silly underneath, of course; and yet,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;older men are very attractive, aren&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you vain thing!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;he should be older than I
am, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow like young Fortescue?&rdquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&nbsp; He thinks too much about his
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s very good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way.&nbsp; And I should want him to be
handsome.&nbsp; I want my boys to be handsome, you see.&nbsp; But
not like Harry Fortescue: he&rsquo;s too pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then.&nbsp; Young Somers-Flint?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s too noisy.&nbsp; He has that
terrible laugh.&nbsp; I should want him to be amusing, of course,
and see all the funny things in life, but more quietly.&nbsp;
Besides, I can&rsquo;t stand men with thin noses.&nbsp; His nose
is absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want big noses,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what about
Harold Swain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s just the other extreme,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a&mdash;what do you call those
birds at the Zoo, all colours with little eyes set like jewels
and enormous beaks?&nbsp; I know&mdash;toucans.&nbsp; The
man&rsquo;s a toucan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s over six feet and a first-class
cricketer,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I like that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should like him to be good at games.&nbsp; But he mustn&rsquo;t
be grotesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you can mention some one who comes at any rate
nearer your ideal?&nbsp; What about&rdquo;&mdash;I did my best to
make my voice sound natural&mdash;&ldquo;what about
Ronnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not look at her, so I cannot say whether Rose blushed or
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie,&rdquo; she said meditatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I like Ronnie.&nbsp; Ronnie is a dear.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronnie is to play with,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not for a husband.&nbsp; I should want my
husband to be stronger than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; I said, quite normal again,
&ldquo;there are other things besides looks and character.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s employment, for example.&nbsp; Do you want <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>him to be
rich and idle or do you want him to be busy?&nbsp; And if busy,
what do you want him to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;I want him to be
busy.&nbsp; I want him to be away all the day, so that his return
will be an event to both of us.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in
husbands muddling about at home between breakfast and
dinner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure father would have been happier if
his studio had been somewhere else and he had to go away to it
and remain away.&nbsp; He got tired of the house&mdash;I can see
now, although I didn&rsquo;t know then&mdash;instead of looking
on it as a harbour of refuge after his work was done.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what made him so restless and forced him to go away
so much: that and his love of seeing new and beautiful
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be dreadful,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;to be an
artist and have such a keen eye for lovely effects and know that
they can never be really reproduced in paint.&nbsp; I wish we
knew more about Turner and what he felt.&nbsp; He came nearer
getting it than anyone, I suppose; but he must have suffered
agonies of disappointment and failure.&nbsp; The worst of it is,
he seemed never to let anyone know him, so we have no
evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t go to the opposite extreme,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and marry a sailor, for you&rsquo;d hardly see him
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t do
that.&nbsp; I should want him to come back every evening, and
stay back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;Then no doctor need apply,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want all his attention when he has finished with
business.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an essential.&nbsp; And a steady
home that I can make like a home, and go on improving.&nbsp; With
a big nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the country, or London?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the country,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;But not
too far out.&nbsp; A place where you can hear the train come in,
and go a little way across the fields to meet him and take away
the fish basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;now I know.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
something in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if he is,&rdquo; said Rose,
&ldquo;so long as he comes back every evening, and loves me, and
makes enough money for me to have a hansom everywhere when I go
to town, and to take the children to the sea in the summer.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my idea of a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you may find him,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
having found him, keep him simple and deeply rooted.&nbsp; And
you must make me a promise.&nbsp; Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let no one but me supply that big nursery with its
rocking-horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we talked; not once but many times.&nbsp; And this Prince
Charming in the guise of a businessman with a tall hat, catching
the 9.15 up and the 5.46 down, became a joke with us: one of us
at any rate, in the English way, which avoids facing facts,
making haste to joke for fear of having to cry.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>For a
while it seemed as though the alarms about the censorious world
were false; but I could rid myself very rarely, and then only for
a few moments, of my fool&rsquo;s paradise convictions.&nbsp;
During the moments that were free from this haunting, our new
united life went along happily.&nbsp; Rose had taken over the
housekeeping by way of experience; we entertained; a
school-fellow came on a visit; we walked over to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s fairly often; there were parties here and
there; and no serpent in the form of a successful lover entered
Eden.</p>
<p>I was more than ever struck by Rose&rsquo;s quiet
detachment.&nbsp; She had no absorbing interests: most things
found her ready to scrutinize them, but nothing captured
her.&nbsp; Most young Britons of both sexes have their hobbies
and overwork them, but Rose moved serenely through the days,
getting everything done and apparently having time to turn aside
if occasion called.&nbsp; I admired this gift immensely.&nbsp; My
own tendency is to concentrate almost too exclusively.&nbsp; If
she had a hobby it was the arranging of flowers, and I think that
her skill and taste in this charming and neglected branch of
domestic art amounted to genius.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And then, further refusals being no longer possible, Rose
accepted an invitation to her Aunt Stratton&rsquo;s, and nothing
was ever the same again.&nbsp; O that woman!</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>I could
see that something was wrong directly Rose came back.&nbsp; We
were sufficiently on terms of intimacy for wireless to be
established between us: at any rate from her to me.&nbsp; She did
not exactly exhibit constraint, but there was something, as we
say, on her mind.&nbsp; I was conscious of that.&nbsp; She talked
freely enough; gathered up the strings of local life in her
absence; told me something of the Strattons, the only one of whom
that she really cared for being Angelica, the youngest, a girl of
about twelve.&nbsp; Her Uncle George she liked, in a negative
way; perhaps, more accurately, was sorry for.&nbsp; The others we
didn&rsquo;t discuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over anyway,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
nothing would get me to go abroad with them.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo; and then she stopped.</p>
<p>I waited for the rest of the sentence, but it never
came.&nbsp; Instead, she asked some question about our own
neighbourhood and we passed on to other interests.</p>
<p>But I guessed then what she was meaning to say and later
discovered that I was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;she was
thinking&mdash;&ldquo;although the visit to the Strattons is
over, I shall have to be away a good deal, if not altogether,
because it&rsquo;s not suitable for Dombeen and me to be alone in
this house.&nbsp; People are going to talk&mdash;and I
couldn&rsquo;t allow Dombeen to have to suffer from
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were her thoughts&mdash;the fruit of
Milly Stratton&rsquo;s insinuations.&nbsp; That she herself would
suffer did not matter.&nbsp; Eighteen can look <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>after itself,
but forty-five must be carefully guarded&mdash;that is how she
would have argued.&nbsp; Eighteen is too immature, but
forty-five, although, of course, an incredibly advanced age,
lends itself to scandal, and doctors must have sound
reputations.</p>
<p>Then set in a broken period which I look back upon without
pleasure.&nbsp; All parents, I suppose, have to go through
similar seasons, when misunderstandings or a want of sympathy
alienate them from their children, or their children from
them.&nbsp; During the time of dependence things can be all
right, and again after independence is attained; but when the
wings are beginning to sprout, sons and daughters have it in them
to be more than difficult.&nbsp; How much of it have I
seen!&nbsp; I was no parent myself, and Rose was not pining for
independence; but she was restless and disturbed because of me:
she did not want to go away, but thought that she ought to,
knowing that I could not.</p>
<p>At last I could stand it no longer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here,
Rose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re not happy.&nbsp; Tell me why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to explain,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
persuaded that it is unsuitable for us to be together here
alone.&nbsp; Your dear Aunt Milly suggested the idea, and you
can&rsquo;t forget it.&nbsp; You think people will
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Dombeen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when did you take
to clairvoyance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your pretty head became transparent,&rdquo; <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, what is to be done?&nbsp; If you feel
like that you must go away&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you were to become engaged I suppose that
everybody would be satisfied and we could go on as we are.&nbsp;
Our only saviour is that punctual husband, with the tall hat and
the fish-basket.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s not yet on the
horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I soon began to have proofs of the accuracy of the Stratton
prediction.&nbsp; It is extraordinary&mdash;especially in a
country district where no one in easy circumstances has enough to
do&mdash;how intensely interesting the affairs of other people,
neighbours chiefly, can be, and how difficult it is not to be
inquisitive and censorious.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suggest that in a
city there are no meddlesome onlookers, with fingers sharpened
for pies that do not belong to them; but in a city there are more
distractions and there are also certain impediments to
familiarity.&nbsp; In the country you are bound, unless there has
been a feud, to know your neighbours; but one may live at No. 5
in a London terrace for half a century and never meet the
occupants of No. 4 and No. 6.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had been on terms of pleasant and easy intimacy
with most of my patients; and where there was less cordiality it
was probably <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>not my fault.&nbsp; A certain interest in my affairs had
been shown&mdash;there had been questions as to my biggest break
recently, as to what I was sending to the Flower Show, the size
of marrows, the chance of the Isle of Wight disease among the
hives, and, of course, inquiries after Rose.&nbsp; But no
more.&nbsp; No one had ventured to give advice.&nbsp; But now I
began to detect admonitory symptoms, fumblings towards counsel as
to conduct.</p>
<p>Lady Fergusson, for example, Ronnie&rsquo;s mother, after a
long talk about pelargoniums, wondered if it were true that dear
Rose was going to the Riviera with the Strattons.&nbsp; So nice
for her to be with young people.&nbsp; So nice to be able to go
away.&nbsp; It was much to be hoped that nothing would
interfere.&nbsp; How fortunate some girls were!&nbsp; In her
youth there had been no such gadding about.&nbsp; And so
forth.</p>
<p>Then the rector&rsquo;s wife, Mrs. Cumnor, a good enough woman
in her way but overburdened with family cares&mdash;not however
so overburdened that she had no time or strength left to take on
the cares of others as well: mine and Rose&rsquo;s, for instance;
she too began to cut in.</p>
<p>Rose, she said one morning, after I had finished with her
second daughter&rsquo;s pulse, chest and temperature, was, she
knew, never ill.&nbsp; How enviable a state!&nbsp; And so active
and clever too.&nbsp; Now that she had finished with school she
would, of course, with such a constitution, go out into the
world.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;Might not her vocation be at home?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it would be hard for you to have to lose
her,&rdquo; Mrs. Cumnor conceded, &ldquo;terribly hard;
but&mdash;&rdquo; and then she changed the subject.</p>
<p>Her husband, who had clearly been put up by his wife to
contribute something to the campaign, was more jovial about it:
wondering if any young men would dare to propose to a girl who
was always in the company of such a handsome guardian.&nbsp; Was
it fair to Rose to have a resident spoilsport?&nbsp; And so
on&mdash;with plenty of hearty laughter as an ameliorative.</p>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman confirmed my fears as to the
neighbourhood&rsquo;s determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole pack&rsquo;s in full cry after you,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too happy for them: they
can&rsquo;t bear the sight of it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re free
too&mdash;and so many of them are shackled for life and full of
nasty envy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the best possible world!&nbsp;
And yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only one I
want.&nbsp; Perfection would be very boring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re beaten.&nbsp; The
pack has won.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s only anticipating your fate by
a few months.&nbsp; All parents have to lose their children, and
you&rsquo;ve been luckier than most.&nbsp; Rose is certain sure
to marry, and marry young too, so you&rsquo;d have lost her at
twenty any way, if not before.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s on the road to
nineteen now, and you mustn&rsquo;t grumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;And what is there left for me?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&mdash;why that doesn&rsquo;t matter, because you
don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a sterile old stick.&nbsp;
Sterility has no vote.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll just rub along, getting
through the days, till the end.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had your
chance and lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give me much encouragement,&rdquo; I
complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
truth is the only thing worth having, and, in a civilized life,
like ours, where so many risks are removed, facing it is almost
the only courageous thing left to do.&nbsp; But you might marry
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, you must rust and bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold comfort indeed!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If ever there were two people on this planet who might have
been let alone, and wanted to be let alone, and deserved to be
let alone, they were Rose and I.&nbsp; But it was not to be.</p>
<p>While with the Strattons, at some &ldquo;At Home,&rdquo; Rose
had met a Mrs. Lovell, who was about to go into business as a
florist, and she had offered Rose a post.&nbsp; It was to be a
florist&rsquo;s of a new kind, for not only were flowers to be
sold but they were to be arranged too.&nbsp; The staff was to
include flower-arrangers who on the evenings of dinner-parties
would go out to decorate the tables.&nbsp; Premises <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>had been
taken, just off the Brompton Road, and already a connection was
being formed.&nbsp; If Mrs. Lovell still had room for her, said
Rose, she would go.&nbsp; It was not what she had dreamed of, but
it was something definite, a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so little for an untrained girl to do,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if I was brought up to
have to earn my own living.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to be fairly
well off, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re
twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But at the
moment, if I have to go, I should like to try to be
independent.&nbsp; And of course, I have to go,&rdquo; she added:
&ldquo;it was cowardly to say &lsquo;if.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t teach: I don&rsquo;t know anything.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t type or do shorthand.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be
a companion to an old lady&mdash;unless it were to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman; but she&rsquo;s got Julia.&nbsp; But I like being
among flowers, even though they&rsquo;re cut, and I like Mrs.
Lovell, and I think that&rsquo;s a Heaven-sent opening.&nbsp;
Almost no one arranges flowers as a profession now.&nbsp; The
only one I&rsquo;ve heard of is a little Japanese man.&nbsp; So
we shall have the field to ourselves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fun to be
doing something original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And soon afterwards she went.</p>
<p>Of this part of Rose&rsquo;s life I have little to say.&nbsp;
I can tell only what I know at first hand.&nbsp; Whenever I was
in London&mdash;but that was very seldom&mdash;I called at the
florist&rsquo;s; and Rose came down for Sundays now and
then.&nbsp; She seemed to be happy and uncomplicated.&nbsp;
Whether her <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>association with me&mdash;whether my general tutelary
influence in her earlier years&mdash;was being of any use to her
I had no means of judging.&nbsp; She might have been equally
capable without it.&nbsp; Educationalists never know.</p>
<p>The flower scheme failed to prosper, but Rose did not give up
London.&nbsp; Even if there were not the same objection to
returning to live with me, she had probably lost the wish to do
so.&nbsp; I am sure that she was fond of me, but she had made new
friends.&nbsp; London was full of variety and attraction, and she
had contracted the habit of employment and liked it.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know anything about the economics of a
florist&rsquo;s business, except that to me the thought of having
to pay money for flowers is repellent: flowers, one feels, should
be free to all; but Mrs. Lovell had not enough experience and
Rose was quite capable of giving a bunch of daffodils away rather
than haggle over the price.&nbsp; Moreover, the time was not ripe
for the professional arranger.&nbsp; I do not know that it is
even yet.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Lovell, however, Rose remained true, and therefore
continued with her as an ally in her next scheme, which was an
old curiosity shop.&nbsp; Not an old curiosity shop where oddity
was the prevailing note, but an old curiosity shop where
everything had some beauty, either of shape or colour, or was
picturesquely obsolete.&nbsp; Such shops, I have observed on my
London expeditions, are now very numerous, but Mrs.
Lovell&rsquo;s was <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>one of the first.&nbsp; They are usually directed by
women.&nbsp; Just as a man may sell wine or be secretary to a
golf club and lose no caste, so may what we call ladies keep
these shops.&nbsp; Blue and green and purple glass; old stuff for
patchwork quilts; spinning wheels; Stafford and Leeds jugs; lace;
amber necklaces; beads; brass pestles and mortars; painted
rolling-pins; early Victorian dolls&mdash;the place was full of
things of that kind, and Rose, in a charming smock, was standing
in the midst of it on the day that I unexpectedly looked in,
smilingly engaged in the task&mdash;an easy one&mdash;of selling
a very young and obviously adoring curate a warming-pan: not, as
he was explaining, for use, but for decoration.&nbsp; On seeing
me she blushed very becomingly and nearly broke the little
divine&rsquo;s heart by her too apparent eagerness to turn to the
new customer.</p>
<p>Rose begged the afternoon off&mdash;and it was the kind of
shop that did itself very little harm by shutting up for the
whole day now and then&mdash;and we met for lunch and then
loitered about in Kew Gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has that little curate proposed to you yet?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose a great many men come to that shop?&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very jolly too, some of
them, until they fall in love; and then they&rsquo;re so
dull.&nbsp; <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Isn&rsquo;t it funny what a difference it makes?&nbsp;
And then they propose and I lose them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I, I thought to myself, have lost Rose!&nbsp; Is loss the
rule of life?&nbsp; It seems to be.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was on one of Rose&rsquo;s week-end visits just before she
was twenty that she took out a photograph and handed it to
me.&nbsp; The photograph was an amateur snapshot of a group on a
lawn, among whom was Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite good of you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me
that I wanted you to look at, but the man behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is strange what effect the most ordinary words can
sometimes have!&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s were casual enough, but my
heart absolutely stopped for a moment and a mist crossed my
brain.&nbsp; God knows I did not want to keep this child from
marriage; her engagement would even be a blessing in disguise,
for it would bring her back to her home; but her remark none the
less was like a knell.</p>
<p>And yet she had told me nothing!&nbsp; Nothing&mdash;and to
the fearful swift apprehension of a jealous foster-father,
everything!</p>
<p>I pulled myself together and examined the man: tall,
regular-featured, with a high forehead due more to thinning hair
than to formation of skull.&nbsp; Eyeglasses.&nbsp; His general
expression suggested a somewhat condescending benignity, with
assurance.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Eustace Holt,&rdquo; Rose said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He wants me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I heard my voice say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no more words.&nbsp; I drew her to me and kissed her
hair.&nbsp; The action, I suppose, implied a kind of possessive
protectiveness.&nbsp; I had wondered vaguely how I should behave
when the news broke: and this was the way!</p>
<p>After a long silence Rose went on to say that he was a
barrister; had been a private tutor for a while after leaving
Oxford, but was now at the Bar and beginning to do well in
chamber practice.&nbsp; Not an advocate.</p>
<p>I looked at the photograph again.&nbsp; Probably I should have
been cool about any young man who had captured Rose&rsquo;s
heart, knowing so well that none could be worthy; but to this one
I felt positive hostility.&nbsp; He had the effect of filling me
with a sudden warm rush of affection for Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>She knew me sufficiently to discern a want of sympathy; but I
hope that I succeeded in concealing the greater part of my
antagonism.&nbsp; You see, I was still a liar.&nbsp; Not all my
intimacy with Rose and admiration for her candour had cured
me.&nbsp; Perhaps had I said, &ldquo;My dear, I hate the sight of
the man: he looks priggish: do promise me to do nothing about it
for six months,&rdquo; it might have changed her life.&nbsp; At
any rate it could have <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>done no harm, and it would have had
the additional merit of expressing a truth.&nbsp; But I
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; For one thing, I had not the courage to be
destructive about her own choice, when the romance was still so
young; for another, I had not the right.&nbsp; She had seen the
man and loved the man, or thought she did; and all the ground for
my sudden prejudice was a tiny snapshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not what I was expecting for you or hoping
for you,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, not in
appearance.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s too&mdash;too
urban.&nbsp; Too prim.&nbsp; In spite of what I said about the
fish-basket, I have always thought of your husband as more
careless, easy-going, gayer than this.&nbsp; I had thought of him
as having something of Nature&mdash;more of the open air or the
sea&mdash;but this man&rsquo;s from the Squares.&nbsp; He travels
in the Tube.&nbsp; He carries an umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dombeen,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;how can you
know things like that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t, and
I&rsquo;ve seen quite a lot of him.&nbsp; He may be a Londoner,
but that&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; Barristers must live in
London.&nbsp; I wish I hadn&rsquo;t shown you that foolish
picture.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s really very distinguished looking, he
has a most delightful voice, he does everything well.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a plus man at golf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that
isn&rsquo;t the point.&nbsp; The point is not, is he a remarkable
man, but is he fitted to be Rose&rsquo;s husband?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known you for as many years as you have been <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>on this
earth, and I&rsquo;ve watched you grow up in body and mind, and
perhaps I&rsquo;ve been able to help you in both&mdash;and when
we help people we learn about them&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve thought
often of the best kind of man to carry you away from me when the
time came, but never was it a polished Londoner marked out for
professional eminence.&nbsp; Where&mdash;just to mention one
trifling matter&mdash;where are his jokes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jokes aren&rsquo;t everything.&nbsp; But any way he can
be quite amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jokes go a long way,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and you
especially would be very dull without them.&nbsp; As for his
golf, that&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; Golf isn&rsquo;t really a game,
nor does it really carry any open-air love with it.&nbsp; How old
is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thirty-four,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-four, thinning at the top, once a tutor, now a
barrister, and going to marry this uncalculating child!&nbsp; O
my dear!&rdquo; I said.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was of course absurd of me to be shocked by Rose&rsquo;s
choice of a husband.&nbsp; I suppose that there never was a girl
yet whose selection did not cause surprise.&nbsp; The strange
thing to male observers of these matches is the want of
fastidiousness that even the nicest women can display.&nbsp; Rose
had not erred in that respect, but it is notorious among men that
most women do.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>I took
my disappointment to Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman, but she had no sympathy
for me.&nbsp; All that she did was to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be so elementary as to make use of that
paltry phrase?&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>She laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Years ago.&nbsp; And often since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you did,&rdquo; I conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, let a poor lonely old woman full of
uric acid, with an extremely incompetent medical adviser, enjoy
her little triumph!&nbsp; If poor human nature couldn&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; now and then, we&rsquo;d hardly have
the courage to keep on at all at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are one
of the most remarkable of far-sighted women.&nbsp; Deborah the
prophetess was a blind mute compared with you; Mother Shipton was
an Aunt Sally.&nbsp; I give you all the praise and glory.&nbsp;
But meanwhile, what is to be done?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that Rose
is making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people who marry do,&rdquo; said this monstrous
old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then can&rsquo;t it be stopped?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&nbsp; Surely you&rsquo;ve heard
the remark&mdash;I&rsquo;m not very original this afternoon,
I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rsquo;Marriage is a
lottery&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then there&rsquo;s nothing for you to do.&nbsp;
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>It may be
all right.&nbsp; You say that he&rsquo;s respectable, a
barrister, not poor, not deformed.&nbsp; How then can you stop
it?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got nothing to go on, no valid
excuse.&nbsp; If he were a dwarf you might do something; or a
tenor with long hair.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t see how you could
stop her even then, because in marriage the promising matches
often go wrong and the apparently ill-assorted have a very good
time.&nbsp; Besides, she&rsquo;s only a few months from being her
own mistress.&nbsp; You can grumble, but you can&rsquo;t
prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all the comfort that I got from Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But there was one drop of sweetness in this bitter
draught.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s engagement meant that she returned to
me; she gave up her work almost at once.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, was as it had been.&nbsp; (Nothing, says the
cynic, ever is.)&nbsp; Our old frank intimacy was over.&nbsp; We
had our talks and our walks and our fun still; but there was a
skeleton at the feast, and he was a rising barrister.&nbsp; Rose
didn&rsquo;t mention him much, nor did I.&nbsp; But she wrote
long letters, and received long letters, and I had no doubt that
Eustace Holt received those that she wrote and signed those that
she received.&nbsp; And then one evening she suggested that he
should be asked down.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to see him sooner or
later,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s still on?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should have
told you if it hadn&rsquo;t been.&nbsp; When you meet him
you&rsquo;ll like him.&nbsp; Or you would if you hadn&rsquo;t
made up your mind not to, and haven&rsquo;t got the pluck to eat
humble pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never liked him, but it would have been difficult to say
why.&nbsp; He was tall, comely, well-mannered, deferential,
thoughtful about details, protective of Rose (perhaps that was
his real offence), uniformly quiet and easy.&nbsp; What he lacked
most conspicuously was any exaggerated characteristic.&nbsp; He
conversed fluently and with some knowledge upon all the cultured
topics&mdash;he knew about pictures and music, as a frequenter of
the National Gallery and the Crystal Palace concerts; he belonged
to the London Library; he played golf at the Old Deer Park; he
had good nails.&nbsp; He dressed well.&nbsp; His suit case was of
the solidest leather.&nbsp; In fact, he was all that he should
have been and&mdash;alas!&mdash;nothing that he should not.&nbsp;
He reminded me of a well-bound book in a gentleman&rsquo;s
library&mdash;the kind of book that no gentleman&rsquo;s library
should be without, but which makes no appeal to be read.</p>
<p>I am not one of those who fling up their hands in despair and
wonder what on earth a sensible girl like So-and-So can see in
that fellow she&rsquo;s going to marry.&nbsp; But even when one
admits that <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>the deeps that call to deeps in engaged people are and
should be invisible to the rest of the world, it is permissible
to parents and guardians to deplore the reciprocity.&nbsp; The
deeps are not all: in fact the attraction of the deeps can be the
least permanent and admirable element in marriage.</p>
<p>I knew enough of Rose&rsquo;s spirit, her vividness, her
dependence upon impulse, her love of life, to realize that she
was doomed to spend far too much time alone.&nbsp; Eustace had
all the virtues, but he had no imagination.&nbsp; He was also
fixed where Rose was fluid.&nbsp; He had his eye on the goal
success; whereas all that Rose asked from life was a gay
serenity.&nbsp; She was in the habit of watching faces light up
at her approach: &ldquo;People,&rdquo; you might have written on
her tombstone as sufficient epitaph, &ldquo;were pleased to see
her&rdquo;; and all of that was doomed to pass, not because she
would be less liked but because she would not be free: she was to
be reincarnated as the property of another, as Mrs. Eustace
Holt.</p>
<p>Still, there is more than one kind of happiness; there is
even, I have observed, a happiness to be derived from misery: all
doctors would testify to this; and Rose might find, in her home
duties and the practice of wifeliness, a complacency that would
take the place of the old radiating freedom.&nbsp; I use the word
&ldquo;might&rdquo; with emphasis: it is all that is possible to
parents and guardians who are threatened with the loss of their
treasure and have gloomy prevision.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>In my
case I was truly hoping against hope, because I had had a
shock.&nbsp; On one of Eustace&rsquo;s visits I made a discovery
about him which filled me with the darkest forebodings.&nbsp; I
had found him one afternoon just before post time seated in the
library steaming a stamp off a postcard.&nbsp; Rose, it appears,
had had occasion to write a rapid order to some shop and, having
no halfpenny stamp (for those were the days before the blessings
of peace had sent up the postcard rate), she had
characteristically stuck on a twopenny-halfpenny one from a store
which I kept for foreign correspondence; and Eustace had been
entrusted with the card for the post.&nbsp; But his careful eye
had detected the extravagance, and when I came upon him he was
removing the twopenny-halfpenny stamp and substituting a
halfpenny one from his own pocket.&nbsp; Knowing Rose as I did, I
would rather have found him burgling my safe or even kissing one
of the maids; for the action argued a passion for thrift which
would lead in time to the sternest censure of the unthinking
carelessness in money matters and the constant generosities which
were among her most striking characteristics.</p>
<p>The worst of it was that he did not pale or start when I
caught him: he merely expressed his satisfaction at having been
able to correct Rose&rsquo;s folly in time.&nbsp; He then dried
the foreign stamp, handed it gravely to me for future use
(&ldquo;It will need a little gum,&rdquo; he said) and hastened
to <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the
post.&nbsp; If ever a home-wrecker was saturated with innocence
it was he.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I was in hopes that Rose&rsquo;s formal visit to
Eustace&rsquo;s people might have the effect of implanting some
misgivings in her.&nbsp; Such expeditions have had that effect in
the past, when the impact of the &ldquo;people&rdquo; has been so
startling as to cause a complete revision of the
affections.&nbsp; But not so in Rose&rsquo;s case, and she came
back still an engaged woman.&nbsp; (By the way, I did not approve
of the ring which Eustace had given her: it was not the
superlatively beautiful thing that she ought to have had.&nbsp;
Rose should have had some great noble stone in an invisible
setting&mdash;a ruby or an emerald&mdash;but Eustace had chosen
and sent her a muddle of little pearls and diamonds.)</p>
<p>Eustace&rsquo;s father was a clergyman in Berkshire, a rather
querulous man, Rose said, but hospitable and kindly to her.&nbsp;
Mrs. Holt was more difficult.&nbsp; &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; Rose
added, &ldquo;mothers always must be critical of their future
daughters-in-law.&nbsp; No girl can be good enough for their
darling sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eustace being the only son, the mother was, of course,
additionally hard to please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you leave her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resigned rather than rapturous,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I did nothing very terrible, but I fancy that she suspects
you as a trainer of youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Not so much as I suspect her,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;as a judge of brides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole thing infuriated me.</p>
<p>Another cause of vexation at this time was Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.</p>
<p>We are annoyed when our old friends like our new friends too
much; but we are even more annoyed when our old friends refuse to
share our antipathies to new acquaintances.&nbsp; Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman disappointed me deeply by not finding Eustace as
unsuitable as I did.&nbsp; Perhaps she was only being wilfully
provocative, but the effect on me was the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very intelligent old lady,&rdquo; Eustace called her,
to me.&nbsp; Perhaps a little too outspoken, a little lacking in
taste.&nbsp; But very refreshing.&nbsp; A character, in
fact.&nbsp; No one enjoyed studying a character more than
he.&nbsp; And there were so few of them!</p>
<p>I have just said that few things are more annoying than an old
friend&rsquo;s approval of a new acquaintance that we
dislike.&nbsp; But I think that to hear an old friend
patronizingly appraised by an incompetent critic is almost
worse.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman was a character: there was no
doubt about that; but Eustace had only a glimmering of that
fact.</p>
<p>My peace of mind was further impaired by Rose&rsquo;s tendency
to play with the joke that I also must marry.&nbsp; It was not a
new idea; but hitherto she had been very light with me.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;What we must do, Dombeen,&rdquo; she had said to
me one day not long after her decision to go to London to Mrs.
Lovell, &ldquo;is to get you settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; I had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wife,&rdquo; she said, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t be left all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like being alone,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;that is, when
you&rsquo;re not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to marry,&rdquo; Rose said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Every one says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Cumnor says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pay any attention to the wives of the
clergy,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Milly says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Milly!&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; She has never
wished me anything but ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should feel much happier in London if I thought you
were not alone,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
were not unhappy at school, and I was alone then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Rose went on to select actual wives!&nbsp; I used to
wonder what she really thought about it all, but never
discovered.&nbsp; It was not like her to be so persistent with a
theme.&nbsp; She usually touched and passed on.&nbsp; Could it be
that we were out of harmony in graver matters, and she jested to
keep free of them?</p>
<p>She would come back to lunch, after being in the village, with
new and fantastic plans for my marriage.&nbsp; Every spinster and
widow within a <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>five mile radius was weighed as a possible Mrs.
Greville.&nbsp; Rose dismissed Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman as too old,
but her faithful Julia came under the lens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; she was kind enough to say, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t let you marry her.&nbsp; A woman must have some
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three unmarried sisters&mdash;the Misses Sturgis&mdash;had
recently taken the Allinsons&rsquo; old house&mdash;after one or
two fleeting and unattractive tenants.&nbsp; Rose saw a good deal
of them just now, and I was on more or less familiar terms both
as a doctor and a neighbour.</p>
<p>The sisters, who were refined and affluent, had been brought
up as Quakers, but they quaked no more nor did they harbour any
resentment against our &ldquo;steeple-house&rdquo;; they had
become indeed useful members of the congregation, receiving from
the rector the preferential treatment meted out to this
particular sect even when it retains its nonconformity.</p>
<p>Rose was never tired of analysing each&mdash;Miss Sturgis,
Miss Hester and Miss Honor&mdash;as a possible wife for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking at Hester Sturgis again this
morning,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really she&rsquo;s very
nice.&nbsp; She has very pretty hair, don&rsquo;t you
think?&nbsp; She is writing an essay on Walter Pater for the next
meeting of the Lowcester Literary Society.&nbsp; She particularly
hoped that you wouldn&rsquo;t be there, Dombeen.&nbsp; She says
you&rsquo;re so critical, she&rsquo;d be terrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>I
gave Rose the assurance that I should not be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if wives ought to be afraid of their
husbands,&rdquo; the minx went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean, of their
intellects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no sign of comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor Sturgis is extraordinarily nice too, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo; Rose continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like the
way she talks?&nbsp; She has the kind of voice that reminds you
of that speech in <i>King Lear</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love
gentle voices, Dombeen?&nbsp; She is tall, too.&nbsp; I believe
she&rsquo;s only an inch shorter than you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
absurd when husbands are immense and their wives little,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see what an imp she could be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honor is writing a description of a visit to
Chamounix,&rdquo; Rose went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what the Lowcester Literary Society would do if the Sturgises
hadn&rsquo;t come to liven it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got on very well before they arrived,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Sturgis was in the garden,&rdquo; Rose
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderful with flowers, they
say.&nbsp; If she just put a walking-stick into the ground it
would grow.&nbsp; I expect that you and she together would have
the most stunning garden in the world.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s not
really old, not more than thirty-eight.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think that married people should be nearly of an age?&nbsp; Some
day, when I have enough courage, I shall ask
Honor&mdash;she&rsquo;s the easiest, I think&mdash;why
they&rsquo;ve never married.&nbsp; <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>With all their money, too!&nbsp; But
Quaker girls often don&rsquo;t, I believe.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
funny, because I should think they&rsquo;d make wonderful wives,
so placid and sensible, don&rsquo;t you know.&nbsp; What do you
think, Dombeen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of the whole subject,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Eustace was exhibited not only to me&mdash;and, I am aware
that, to ordinary prospective bridegrooms, these probationary
visits (probationary, but too late for remedy) must be a very
trying ordeal and we ought not to be too hard&mdash;but to the
Strattons.&nbsp; What Rose&rsquo;s cousins thought of him I have
no means of knowing, but I suppose that girls are as critical of
other girls&rsquo; fianc&eacute;s as we can be of the young women
whom our friends so mistakenly believe to be Minervas or
Venuses.&nbsp; But Mrs. Stratton, even if she may have had a
touch of envious regret that Eustace had not first seen her
daughters and fallen to one of them, was pleased with her new
nephew.&nbsp; Or so I gathered from a letter to me in which she
congratulated me upon Rose&rsquo;s alliance with so promising a
counsel and so worthy and seemly a man, and went on to refer with
satisfaction to the cessation of unfortunate rumours which the
engagement would bring about.</p>
<p>Eustace, I found, liked her, and had remonstrated with Rose,
but with infinite patience, <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>about her antipathy to the
lady.&nbsp; It was her first disappointment in him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stratton had expressed herself as eager that Rose should
be married from her house, and Rose was willing.&nbsp; I was glad
that she was, for many reasons: I did not, for instance, want the
wedding in our church, or the reception in our house, with
Eustace&rsquo;s people all about; I did not want to see
Rose&rsquo;s husband driving away with her into a new life, alien
to me, from my door, her door.&nbsp; I could not bear the idea of
continuing to entertain the crowd after their departure, when any
decent man would wish to be alone.&nbsp; These were selfish
enough reasons, but also natural.&nbsp; I deny that they lay me
open to any very severe censure.</p>
<p>At the same time I should have liked it had Rose said that
only from her true home would she be married.&nbsp; But she did
not.&nbsp; Not improbably she had that desire, but was anxious to
spare my feelings.&nbsp; She knew that Eustace could never be
congenial to me, and least of all as her captor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I went to the wedding, of course; and I have never been more
miserable.&nbsp; It was enough that my Rose was standing there at
the chancel steps; but there was more.&nbsp; This was my first
wedding for many years, and I was startled by the service.&nbsp;
The gravity and solemnity of the promises exacted <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>from
each&mdash;such promises as not even angels are asked to make and
keep, for there is notoriously no marriage or giving in marriage
among them&mdash;filled me with gloom and foreboding and a sense
of injustice.&nbsp; It seemed wrong to ask any human
beings&mdash;and particularly boys and girls&mdash;to commit
themselves in this way.&nbsp; I wondered if barristers when being
married have thoughts of the Divorce Court in their
minds&mdash;that overworked department of the profession where
the morbid and inquisitive assemble day after day to gloat over
the fragments that remain when all these sacred bonds and
assurances have been broken.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my worldly
goods I thee endow,&rdquo; I heard Eustace repeat after the
clergyman.&nbsp; But did he?&nbsp; Does any husband?&nbsp; What
would be a husband&rsquo;s attitude if the next morning his wife
said that she wanted his property&mdash;all the worldly goods
with which he had publicly endowed her&mdash;at once?&nbsp; The
commonest cause of married unhappiness that I know of is the
refusal of husbands to give their wives even a requisite fraction
of their worldly goods for current household expenses.&nbsp; But
the words will go on being repeated at the chancel steps for many
a year yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sickness and in health&rdquo;&mdash;doctors know
something about the value of that undertaking, too, and how it is
honoured.</p>
<p>And so Rose Allinson became Rose Holt, and those of us who
were nearest the young couple in kin or intimacy followed them
into the vestry <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>to wish them joy and sign the register.&nbsp; Having
kissed my darling and written my name, I slipped away.&nbsp; I
could not endure more.&nbsp; The vestry had a back door and I
slipped through it, pocketed my button-hole carnation, and, after
lunch, went to a sale of mezzotints at Christie&rsquo;s, where I
endeavoured to soothe my feelings by buying two Valentine Greens
which (unless I was to die next week, when one can afford
anything) I couldn&rsquo;t afford.&nbsp; And so far as I could
see then, there was no particular reason why I should not die
next week&mdash;nothing, I mean, important enough to call for my
continued existence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. Eustace Holt was, I think, fairly happy in her early
married life.&nbsp; I saw her now and then, and was not conscious
of anything very wrong.&nbsp; She seemed to have lost tone: that
was all; but I put that down largely to living in London, cooped
up by bricks and mortar instead of her old free garden
life.&nbsp; Also Eustace was not exciting.&nbsp; But I think she
was fond of him, and I know that he was very proud of her,
perhaps even to tiring her by exhibiting her too much to his
friends.&nbsp; She was too candid to be a very easy diner-out,
and too courteous not to make the effort.</p>
<p>And then came the tragedy.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s first child died
at the end of only three weeks of life.&nbsp; You remember what
she said about wanting boys.&nbsp; <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>Well, this was a boy, and Rose was
in the seventh heaven of delight.&nbsp; She squandered herself on
it.&nbsp; No other young mother, the nurse told me on that sad
day when we buried the poor little creature, had, in her
experience, been so happy.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that, as you
know,&rdquo; she added to me, &ldquo;is a big thing to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found my poor child inconsolable; in a kind of stupor of
bewilderment and revolt against the blind stupidities of
fate.&nbsp; To let this perfect little being fade into
nothingness and allow the ugly, blundering world to go on!</p>
<p>She was long in recovering and longer still before she was
herself again.&nbsp; I did all I could to get Eustace to let her
come to me to convalesce, but he would not let her out of his
sight, and took her to this and that health resort, and even for
one winter to the Riviera.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was nearly two years before I saw her again, and then I
went up to dine and spend the night by way of celebrating my
fiftieth birthday.&nbsp; That was in 1900.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Every doctor is asked for advice in matrimonial differences,
or at any rate is made a confidant.&nbsp; One can have too many
of such confidences; but I defy any general practitioner, however
brusque and curmudgeonly, to escape them altogether.&nbsp; <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Most of us
have seen so many couples that we can tell at a glance what is
wrong&mdash;which brand of incompatibility is in use.&nbsp; For
there are so many.&nbsp; Temper is supposed to have a monopoly in
this matter, but that is far from the case.&nbsp; There can be
incompatibility in other matters, apparently trifling, and
trifling in fact unless lifelong fetters are involved.&nbsp;
Incompatibility of temperature, for example, where the lute is
rifted because the wife wants all the fresh air that windows and
doors can let in, and the husband rejoices only in a
vacuum.&nbsp; A doctor sees so many of such antipodal
house-mates&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say that all are married
people&mdash;that he comes to divide the world into those who are
healthily disposed and those whose only idea of a window is a
thing to shut.</p>
<p>It is a truism that wedded felicity is a very fragile craft,
liable to be swamped by any unforeseen wave, and it requires the
most delicate seamanship, both at the helm and at the sail.&nbsp;
I have seen marriages ruined by so pleasant a spice to ordinary
intercourse as irony.&nbsp; Irony in a husband, and a tendency in
a wife to depreciate her husband or make him a butt in
public&mdash;these have much misery to answer for.&nbsp; Absence
of mind in a husband can be fatal: an inability to look ahead, to
reserve seats, to order a cab, to remember theatre tickets.&nbsp;
And then, again, over-much presence of mind can be fatal too: an
insistence on punctuality and too much officiousness about the
house.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>I
could not tell which was the cause of the want of sympathy
between Rose and Eustace, but I felt something was wrong almost
directly I entered their door.&nbsp; Outwardly they were pleasant
enough together; but there was no warmth in the air, no
electricity.&nbsp; Rose Holt was not Rose Allinson&mdash;very far
from it.&nbsp; But she was sweeter than ever to me; almost I
could bring myself to be glad that all was not well, for it made
her so tender, so thoughtfully attentive, to her old
friend.&nbsp; It was the Rose of the middle teens over again, but
with a richness and maturity added.&nbsp; Eustace was courteous,
a solicitous host, and I felt spoilt between them.&nbsp; But
there was something wrong.&nbsp; When their eyes met across the
table no light kindled.</p>
<p>It was a comfortable, distinguished house.&nbsp; The furniture
was good.&nbsp; The right books were scattered about, some in
French; the right periodicals.&nbsp; Photographs after the Old
Masters.&nbsp; In Rose&rsquo;s little boudoir were water
colours.</p>
<p>After dinner Eustace left us.&nbsp; He had some difficult
papers to go through and master, and we were left alone.</p>
<p>Rose established me by the fire and sat beside me on a
cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all well with my child?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She did not reply.</p>
<p>For a long while we were silent.&nbsp; I could not ask her to
tell me more; and she would not volunteer because only half the
secret was hers.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;When are you coming to stay with me?&rdquo; I
asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dombeen, I should love to,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible.&nbsp; Eustace doesn&rsquo;t
like me to be away, ever.&nbsp; He counts so on my presence
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he could come too,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; He
doesn&rsquo;t like the house to be left.&nbsp; No, it can&rsquo;t
be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no right to press the case.&nbsp; But I could not
refrain from saying&mdash;&ldquo;Then you are never to visit me
at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course: some day,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
not yet.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t be for a long while.&nbsp; You
see. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I learned that she was again to become a mother.</p>
<p>How the world rushes on!&nbsp; A child grows to be a girl, and
a girl a wife, before one can turn round.&nbsp; And then there is
another child and the same restless urgency sets in once
more.&nbsp; I thought of some lines I had read years and years
ago that had stuck in my mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is so much we ne&rsquo;er can know&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No time, no time!<br />
We seem to only come&mdash;to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I went back feeling all out of tune and dissatisfied.&nbsp;
This may be a common experience with parents after their first
visit to their married daughters; but I had not even thought of
it before.&nbsp; True, I had set out with some vague <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>misgivings,
but so often&mdash;it is almost the rule&mdash;the realization is
better than our fears for it, that I had discounted the
premonition.&nbsp; And now I knew that my girl had made a
mistake.&nbsp; It was not so much that she was unhappy as that
she had lost her old habit of happiness.&nbsp; She had become
passive where she had been vividly active.&nbsp; Instead of joy
she had found resignation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that she was
broken-spirited in any way: but she was too quiet.&nbsp; If I
were God I should be very much ashamed of having added
resignation to young wives&rsquo; armouries.</p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s second baby was a girl.&nbsp; Eustace sent me a
telegram to that effect, and I wondered much on her feelings
toward it.&nbsp; There had been no joy in her voice when she had
told me of its coming.</p>
<p>I went up to see them when Rose the second&mdash;for the child
was named after her mother&mdash;was two weeks old, and was led
into the room by Eustace.</p>
<p>Much could be written on the different demeanour of husbands
on such occasions, for some behave like impresarios and some like
trespassers, some are boisterous and some are perplexed, but
none, however much they want to disguise it, are totally without
pride.&nbsp; Even those husbands who are as much embarrassed and
hampered by their wives presenting them with a son or a daughter
as they would be if their valets were to lose an arm, cannot
wholly conceal their triumph.&nbsp; Eustace, although with cool
reserve, belonged to the impresario class.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>How
often does one hear well-meaning people say, when discussing the
marriages of others (and of course discussion is superfluous and
insipid when marriages are satisfactory), &ldquo;Ah, if only they
had had a child, what a difference it would have
made!&rdquo;&nbsp; But in my experience children can divide
parents quite as much as they can unite them.&nbsp; I may have
entertained some hope that the little pink creature with the dark
silky hair in Rose&rsquo;s arms was to bring Rose and Eustace
closer; but there was no indication of it.&nbsp; Again when their
eyes met no light was kindled.&nbsp; How that other child, that
boy of her desire, would have affected the love of husband and
wife it was not now possible to say; but this little helpless
mite in its mother&rsquo;s arms obviously was without any
federating gift.</p>
<p>Eustace said a few nice things to Rose, and something about
new-born infants being no novelties to me, and left us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little pet, she&rsquo;s so warm and
dependent,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice doctor?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the kindest nurse
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; I said, but I knew that
she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The unwanted children&mdash;are they not tragic figures?&nbsp;
And their name is legion.&nbsp; Every doctor can give you a
list!</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I
don&rsquo;t say that this minute Rose was exactly unwanted.&nbsp;
Rose&mdash;my Rose&mdash;was incapable of coldness to anything
young and soft and helpless, least of all a baby; and Eustace, I
could see, liked being a father.&nbsp; But the Rose who had given
birth to that little boy, and Rose the mother of this little
girl, were worlds asunder.&nbsp; This Rose was affectionate,
thoughtful, dutiful, protective; that other had been transfigured
by maternal ecstasy and pride.</p>
<p>Eustace and I lunched alone, and I did my best to penetrate
his armour, but in vain.&nbsp; How did he think of his
wife?&nbsp; What kind of need of her had he?&nbsp; Was he
disappointed or was all going as he had expected and
wished?&nbsp; Why on earth had she found him attractive and how
had he lost his hold on her?&nbsp; A hint of the possible reason
of his own attitude was offered when, to my question,
Didn&rsquo;t he find himself a little at sea domestically when
Rose was upstairs like this? he replied, No.&nbsp; It seemed that
the direction of the household was his hobby.&nbsp; He arranged
the meals in advance, scrutinized and paid the books, interviewed
the servants.&nbsp; He had done this as a bachelor and liked to
know how his money was being spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow&rdquo;&mdash;the
words came back to me as he talked.</p>
<p>So Rose was not even mistress of her house, had no realm to
queen it in.&nbsp; &ldquo;What women want is a home&rdquo; is an
old-fashioned saying in <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>which I am a believer; and Rose was
without one.&nbsp; All that she had was a footing in Mr.
Holt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>How I longed for some of Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s
trenchancy and candour to tell him of his mistake!&nbsp; But I
had none.&nbsp; I could observe and deduce, but I had not the
courage, or arrogance, to censure.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I went back to my great empty house with a grudge against the
universe.&nbsp; The grudge passed, for I do not dwell on
injustice, but the emptiness remained.&nbsp; And so the next few
years went on, and I grew older and probably more mannered and
narrow.&nbsp; I also took an assistant, who was in time to be a
successor.&nbsp; Meanwhile Eustace prospered and Rose brought up
her little girl in Wilton Place, and I saw them only on rare
occasions.&nbsp; One of the strangest things in life is the ease
with which people who are fond of each other do not meet.&nbsp;
Our tendency is to run in grooves and find it difficult to leave
them.&nbsp; Or to change the metaphor, no matter how big the
world is, most of us are at heart villagers.</p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s letters were regular and, up to a point,
informative; and I wrote with equal regularity.&nbsp; But the
written word, no less than the spoken, often merely conceals the
truth; and I got very little inner information as to the Holt
m&eacute;nage.&nbsp; My deduction was that routine had completely
taken the place of romance (if ever there had been any worth the
name).&nbsp; Rose never complained, <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>but also she never rejoiced.&nbsp;
Her truth-telling impulses were checked by the fact that only
half the story belonged to her.&nbsp; To tell more was to tell
Eustace&rsquo;s share too; and that was not playing the game.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One afternoon, when Rose the second was five, a message
arrived from the Hall to ask me to come at once to see Master
Ronnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ronnie!&nbsp; What is he doing here?&rdquo; I
asked in surprise.&nbsp; When last I had heard of him he was a
soldier in a responsible post in India.&nbsp; I think it was at
Poona; his mother had read me from time to time little bits in
his letters.&nbsp; How old would he be now?&nbsp; Let me see, he
was a year older than Rose, and Rose was twenty-eight.&nbsp;
Twenty-nine.&nbsp; So far as I could recollect, he had never
married.&nbsp; His mother had regretted this, but was always
counting on some nice girl attracting him during his next
leave.&nbsp; She did not want him to be caught by any of those
Anglo-Indians!</p>
<p>And now here he was, and ill.&nbsp; Ronnie and illness were
contradictions in terms, and I asked the messenger what was
wrong.&nbsp; An accident, I presumed.&nbsp; But it was worse than
that.&nbsp; He had had bad fever and could not get it out of his
bones.&nbsp; Ordered home for a long rest and treatment.&nbsp;
Was very thin and white and didn&rsquo;t seem to relish
anything.</p>
<p>When had he arrived?</p>
<p><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Three
days ago, but he wouldn&rsquo;t let them send for me before;
hated to be coddled.</p>
<p>I found him in a very poor state.&nbsp; Some malarial poison
in his system and his spirits low.&nbsp; Poor boy, he was only
the shadow of his old self.&nbsp; But, in a way, more attractive
still, for his illness had given delicacy to his candid, merry
face, and his charm of manner was unimpaired; while one&rsquo;s
pity for his condition increased one&rsquo;s affection for
him.&nbsp; When the admired strong become suddenly the dependent
weak there can be a strengthening of their adherents.</p>
<p>It was while Ronnie was slowly mending, but still only the
shadow of his normal self, that Rose and her little daughter came
to stay with me.&nbsp; Rose had proposed the visit and I was only
too glad to have them.&nbsp; Eustace, she said, was in Paris, on
some commission of inquiry.</p>
<p>I had seen Rose-the-less occasionally, but only in London and
on her best behaviour.&nbsp; Playing on my lawn she was more
natural, and I delighted in her straight little body, her quick
movements and her eager ways.&nbsp; She was like her mother, but
unlike too&mdash;she had a hint of elfishness, which her mother
lacked: she was less essentially womanly; and she had an
imperious touch.&nbsp; She knew what she wanted and her enjoyment
came largely through getting it, whereas her mother as a child
had found things delectable as they came and had not chosen and
demanded.&nbsp; But there was nothing unattractive in the
child&rsquo;s <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>selective impulses: they did not suggest any kind of
rapacity.&nbsp; For the rest, she was very like that earlier
Rose.&nbsp; She made friends as quickly, she asked as many
questions and she was happy all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does mother call you Dombeen?&rdquo; was one of the
first things she wanted to know.</p>
<p>I explained her difficulties with the word Greville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I call you Dombeen too?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>I said that I should like nothing better.</p>
<p>Rose&mdash;my own Rose&mdash;I found older and graver.&nbsp;
She could laugh still, and as her visit was prolonged she laughed
oftener and gradually gave up the new habit of thinking visibly
before she spoke.&nbsp; Her impulses being always gay or cordial
or merrily mischievous, she need never have become
cautious.&nbsp; But I could see that she had.&nbsp; It is
melancholy indeed when a natural self-unconsciousness is
destroyed: and that is what had happened.&nbsp; And how often I
have seen it happen elsewhere!&nbsp; One of the prevailing
superstitions of English husbands is that wives are better for
being de-individualized.</p>
<p>One thing that a little perplexed me was Rose&rsquo;s attitude
to her daughter, which appeared to me curiously detached.&nbsp; I
wondered sometimes if there were not some defective sympathy
between them, as between Rose and the child&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
Rose was kind and gentle and a delightful companion to the little
girl; but no fierce maternal flame was discernible.&nbsp; I could
have wished for a glimpse of such a fire: but there was
none.&nbsp; <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>It seemed to me a trifle hard on the mite that she
should be at all out in the cold on account of other
people&rsquo;s affairs; but on the other hand she never seemed
unhappy, or less happy than might be; and Rose had no intention
of unfairness.&nbsp; Besides, human nature can&rsquo;t be
logical.</p>
<p>As Ronnie got better he came oftener and oftener to us, to lie
in a deck-chair in the garden.&nbsp; Rose used to sit by him
there and sometimes read to him, or he told little Rose about
India, very much as the old Colonel had talked to her mother, but
with additional modern piquancies.&nbsp; Now and then Rose and
Ronnie returned to their battleground in the billiard-room; but
he was not strong enough for a long game.&nbsp; Sir Edmund and
Lady Fergusson would now and then walk over to accompany him back
or push his wheeled chair.</p>
<p>Remembering the episode at St. Moritz, I was a little uneasy
to see Ronnie and Rose so much together.&nbsp; But I did not feel
strongly enough about it to interfere, even if interference had
ever been my long suit.&nbsp; Besides, I was so glad to see Rose
happy again.&nbsp; Moreover, Rose was grown up and a mother;
Ronnie was grown up and ill.&nbsp; Not that being grown up adds
anything to power of resistance when emotional temptations
offer.</p>
<p>Perhaps to say that I was uneasy is too strong.&nbsp; Rather
was I not unconscious that that popular plaything, fire, was
adjacent, and yet not conscious enough to be really
apprehensive.&nbsp; It was always possible that Ronnie&rsquo;s
state of dependence <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>and fragility was the only cause of
Rose&rsquo;s solicitude; while it was natural enough for a
convalescing soldier, such as he was, to sun himself in the
company of an old playmate.</p>
<p>I forget how long Rose and Rose stayed with me on that
occasion.&nbsp; But after Ronnie had been taken off to some
seaside resort they returned to London and I was more alone than
ever.&nbsp; That must have been the early summer of 1906.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The next period of importance in this rambling narrative is
October of the same year, and I can place the day exactly,
because on my way toward home I was stopped by some one running
out of the &ldquo;Crown Inn&rdquo; to say that old Pritchard, the
host, had had some kind of a stroke.&nbsp; I found him pretty
bad, the result of some extra conviviality on a life of excessive
and chronic alcoholism, the occasion for which&mdash;and this is
how I remember the date so distinctly&mdash;was his good fortune
over the Cambridgeshire, which that year was won by
Polymelus.</p>
<p>Having done what I could to patch him up, I returned
home.&nbsp; While I had been in the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; a tempest
of cold rain had set in, bringing with it a dreary consciousness
of the end of fine weather.&nbsp; One had the feeling that the
year could never recover: winter was our fate and winter to a
country doctor means too much to do and a great deal of
discomfort, with too few of the <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>roadside compensations which he
gathers as he drives about in the summer and the spring.</p>
<p>My thoughts went naturally to Rose, whose susceptibility to
weather had always been so acute; in whose world, could she plan
it, rain would fall only at night.&nbsp; I was still thinking of
her as I left the car at the garage door and walked into the
house.</p>
<p>On the hall table was an envelope addressed to me in
Rose&rsquo;s writing, but it had not passed through the
post.&nbsp; I took it up with misgivings which all too soon were
to be justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Dombeen&rdquo; (it ran), &ldquo;I have gone
away with Ronnie.&nbsp; He needs me more than anyone else does,
or at least I believe so.&nbsp; Eustace will understand why I
have gone when he begins to think.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far it was
written clearly and directly.&nbsp; But then came some broken
sentences.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for Rose,&rdquo; she had begun, and
then had stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rose is my only&rdquo; she had
begun again and again had stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you&rdquo;
was another false start and was also scored through.&nbsp; The
letter finished merely like this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dearest Dombeen,
think your kindliest of me.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp;
Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long I held the paper in my hand I cannot say; but I then
rang to know how it had got there at all.</p>
<p>Suzanne answered the summons.</p>
<p>I asked her what she knew.</p>
<p>She was crying softly as she told me.&nbsp; Mademoiselle
Rose&mdash;Madame Holt, she should <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>say&mdash;had rushed in &ldquo;toute
&eacute;motionn&eacute;e.&rdquo;&nbsp; She could not wait for
me.&nbsp; She had come in a car.&nbsp; She had written the note
and was gone again.</p>
<p>Did Suzanne know what the note was about?</p>
<p>Ah, yes.&nbsp; Quel dommage!&nbsp; But la vie cannot be kept
within fixed bounds.&nbsp; Pots boil over.&nbsp; All this in her
hard Norman speech.&nbsp; She was fatalistic, but still she wiped
her eyes.</p>
<p>Monsieur would not think less of Madame Holt because of this,
would he?</p>
<p>I assured her that I was not a judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La pauvre petite!&rdquo; Suzanne exclaimed, with a
sob.</p>
<p>She had been so assiduous in spoiling Rose&rsquo;s daughter
when they were with me that I naturally thought these words
referred to the younger of them.&nbsp; But I was wrong.&nbsp; It
was of the older Rose that she was still thinking, for she went
on more brightly: &ldquo;Mais, c&rsquo;est bon.&nbsp; Maintenant
elle sera heureuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Mais oui.&nbsp; Suzanne was certain of it.&nbsp; Madame Holt
would not have taken so great a step if she were not to be
happier for it.</p>
<p>I was astounded at her confidence.</p>
<p>My first impulse was to hasten after the fugitives and try to
bring them to reason.&nbsp; But reflection showed me that this
was impracticable.&nbsp; I had no notion where they had gone or
even when; probably not by train, but all the way in the motor,
and there has never been such an ally of runaways <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>as
petrol.&nbsp; In the old days there was some chance, even though
faint, of tracking and overtaking a pair of horses; but
motor-cars vanish into thin air, leaving rainbow splashes in the
roadway to mock the pursuer in every hue.</p>
<p>Then I wondered if Sir Edmund and Lady Fergusson knew.&nbsp;
For Rose to tell me at once was natural; but would not Ronnie
wish to let a little time elapse before breaking the news?&nbsp;
I guessed so.&nbsp; At any rate, it was not for me to be the
bearer of such ill tidings.&nbsp; If it was for anyone to storm
the citadel, that person was the wronged Eustace.</p>
<p>Eustace?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And what of him?&nbsp; He had been
told as well as I, I supposed.&nbsp; Rose had never done anything
underhand or secretive in her life, and she would have made it a
point of honour to let her husband know that she had cut the
knot.&nbsp; At this moment he was probably sitting, stunned, in
his library, or perhaps with his little Rose in her nursery, and
most likely harbouring evil thoughts of me.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In my dismay and distress I put off dinner for an hour or so,
and walked out into the rain to Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It seemed an occasion for the old
Irish lady&rsquo;s pitiless candour.&nbsp; The equally pitiless
downpour would, I felt, help too.&nbsp; There are times when one
welcomes a storm to fight one&rsquo;s way through.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>My
thoughts were not idle as I stumbled against the torrents.&nbsp;
No aspect of the case did they neglect.&nbsp; I can tell only of
what I know, and I have no information as to Ronnie&rsquo;s hold
on Rose after his return and what steps preceded her decision to
run off with him.&nbsp; But it is not difficult to realize, at
any rate, the temptation.&nbsp; Here was the old friend of her
happiest days once more&mdash;free and I don&rsquo;t doubt more
than rejoiced to see her again.&nbsp; He had been in strange
countries, and probably had carried her image with him through
all his wanderings and loneliness.&nbsp; He had never been
articulately in love with her when they were youthful together;
he had not proposed after that accident&mdash;I am sure she would
have told me if he had, because she knew that I liked him.&nbsp;
When she used to talk to me about her marriage and all those nice
boys who were to gallop about the nursery, I had thought
naturally of Ronnie as their father.&nbsp; One visualizes a
figure on such occasions, and Ronnie sprang into being.&nbsp;
But, as it happened, I was wrong.&nbsp; Rose had not thought of
Ronnie like this: she had merely liked him, automatically so to
speak, and when Eustace came along there was no earlier occupant
of her heart to eject.&nbsp; Eustace found it all too easy.</p>
<p>But after her marriage so much had happened.&nbsp; And it must
never be forgotten that Ronnie compelled interest, all
unconsciously maybe, by the force of personality.&nbsp; He was
quite ordinary in everything but personality, which in his case
<a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>was
physical more than spiritual.&nbsp; His ready smile, his white
teeth, his gaiety, his good humour, his general friendliness and
out-for-funnishness won him an easy way into the good graces of
the world.&nbsp; He was popular almost universally.&nbsp; Rose,
as I have said, had never to my knowledge, or even to my
suspicion, been in love with him; nor he with her in any but a
superficial degree, even if that; but there was always that
intimate experience in Switzerland in the background; and each
had since had too much time to think about the past and to
speculate upon the might-have-been: Rose in the watches of the
night taking stock of her marriage and its disenchantments, and
Ronnie in a foreign land sick of a fever.</p>
<p>Both were older too&mdash;not so much older in years, but
older through what had happened: the passage of time being often
almost negligible in influence compared with certain
experiences.&nbsp; A woman grows mature so swiftly: a three
weeks&rsquo; honeymoon can do it, a night can do it; the birth of
her first child always does it.&nbsp; It may be only in
compartments, but maturity is there somewhere.&nbsp; And
Rose&rsquo;s child was five years of age.&nbsp; As for Ronnie, I
suspect that such adventures among women as had fallen to
him&mdash;and a handsome young officer in India has many
admirers&mdash;had chiefly thrown his thoughts back, in
comparison, to Rose.&nbsp; When he might have won her he had not;
after, when he wished he had, she was another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t say that he had brooded on this, but he <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>probably
recurred to it when least happy; and regret, like love, never
stands still: it increases or it diminishes.</p>
<p>And her disenchantment, her starvation!&nbsp; Eustace&rsquo;s
frigid decorum, his supervision of the housekeeping books, his
morbid interest in her minutest personal expenditure, his
tendency to relapse into the tutor and shape her mind wholly by
his, so that instead of the home containing a rising barrister
and an impulsive, warm-hearted, generous woman it should contain
merely a rising barrister and his female derivative&mdash;all
this had surprised her and depressed her.&nbsp; Marriage, she had
known&mdash;being a normal creature, full of the instinct of her
sex, and not only the instinct but her sex&rsquo;s capacity to
endure&mdash;was necessarily a matter of adjustments.&nbsp; Any
two persons agreeing to live together have to learn each
other&rsquo;s ways and make allowances: even two men and two
women.&nbsp; How much more so then when the two persons suddenly
thus beginning a new and intimate co-habitation are a man and a
woman, natural enemies&mdash;or, at any rate, natural censors of
each other, naturally jealous of each other, naturally
misunderstanding each other!&nbsp; Perhaps the word enemies may
stand.</p>
<p>In the case of her own marriage Rose quickly learned that the
adjustments were all to be hers.&nbsp; The only change that
Eustace made was to add a wife to his house: he kept the same
habits: he played his golf at the Old Deer Park just as he had
always done; he read the books from the <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>London
Library; he took her, regardless of her taste in music, to
concerts.&nbsp; But he had never really loved; he had been
attracted by Rose&rsquo;s gaiety and vividness, even if he had
neglected to cherish those qualities after they had passed into
his keeping; he had known that rising barristers are usually
furnished with wives, and that they do not rise the less because
those wives are beautiful.&nbsp; He had known also that marriage
is a natural state; that the duty of a good citizen is to have
children; that wives can be more comfortable than housekeepers;
and so on.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that he had put any of these
thoughts into words: they were merely the outcome of common
knowledge.&nbsp; Nor do I want to be unfair to him or to suggest
that he was not proud and affectionate.&nbsp; I think that he
was.&nbsp; But again I say that he had no imagination: he took
things for granted, and directly a husband does that he is
doomed.</p>
<p>Eustace&rsquo;s refined and comfortable home in Wilton Place
was never disgraced by anything so unseemly as passion or even
eagerness.&nbsp; Returning from his chambers he had never upset
furniture in his desire to get to her.&nbsp; When he brought
flowers to her and she crushed them to her bosom in an ecstasy of
enjoyment, a spasmodic return to nature, he warned her that she
was in danger of breaking the stalks.&nbsp; He had brought the
flowers though.&nbsp; That is the trouble: he was always nice and
handsome and courteous.&nbsp; But there it stopped.&nbsp; Having
no imagination, no instinctive <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>knowledge of women, no sexual
shorthand, he was unaware that nice men are negligible.&nbsp;
What women want is not niceness but devotion, not courtesy but
worship.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;I was still fumbling towards an explanation of
Rose&rsquo;s desperate act&mdash;then there was the
disappointment about the boys.&nbsp; Rose, as I have said, had
set her heart on being a mother, and the mother of sons, and
there was only one surviving child and that was a girl.&nbsp; I
have brought enough children into the world to know something
about the part that they play in married life, and I can set it
down firmly as a fact that it is all to the bad when the sex of
the child is not that which the parents had desired.&nbsp; The
girl who ought to have been a boy has to suffer for it; and so,
though in a less degree, does the boy who ought to have been a
girl, but he is not a common figure.&nbsp; Has it ever been
suggested, I wonder, that some of the traditional alleged
untrustworthiness of women is due to the fact that they were not
wanted.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that I agree as to this
inferiority of the sex, but proverbial lore, which is the wisdom
of many and the wit of one, has decided that they are false and
fickle, unstable, coy and hard to please, and so forth: and that
may be a cause.&nbsp; Certain it is that the nurse who announces
that the little pet is a girl is rarely treated as a bringer of
good news; whereas if she can say it&rsquo;s the finest boy she
ever had in her arms she is, for the moment, an angel.&nbsp; Why
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>should
an unwanted child trouble to be constant and true and without
caprice?&nbsp; Some revenge it is entitled to.</p>
<p>Rose, however, does not come within the category of the
unwanted, for her sex had been determined by her father and
mother months before I assisted at her d&eacute;but, and her name
had long been chosen.&nbsp; Why they should have desired a girl
instead of another of the lords of creation, I cannot say:
probably because the father was an artist, and artists are
notoriously eccentric.&nbsp; But there it was: they wanted a girl
and they had one, whereas that girl, when her own time of
fulfilment came, wanted not only a boy but many boys, and could
not bring up one.&nbsp; Rose, I am sure, had a feeling of
resentment for the girl who had lived where the boy had
died.&nbsp; With that tiny boy baby much of her joy in life was
buried.&nbsp; He had lived long enough in the actual world for
her to make a little god of him; and before that life had been
there was the life he had lived under her heart.</p>
<p>To say that she was not fond of Rose would be to tell an
absolute falsehood&mdash;she took a grave pleasure in her,
although treating her perhaps more as a toy than a daughter, as a
wonderful doll whose capacities she never tired of
studying&mdash;but she was steeped in a deeper rapture when her
breast nurtured a son.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p>To put it in another way, I don&rsquo;t believe that when
Ronnie arrived and opened the door upon whatever fair prospect he
displayed to her or <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>she imagined she saw&mdash;whatever
avenue of escape&mdash;Rose would have stepped through had the
child she was to leave behind her been a little boy of five
instead of a little girl.</p>
<p>Who knows what women feel?&nbsp; We may guess, but they will
never tell us.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t even tell each other.&nbsp;
As regards Rose and Ronnie, my guess is that his pathetic
collapse attracted more than his radiant vigour would have
done.&nbsp; Had she found him triumphant, as of old, she would
have remained unscathed.&nbsp; Strong and masterful he might have
called to her in vain, for she was never a sensualist.&nbsp; It
was his dependence that swayed her and decided her.&nbsp; It was
the boy Ronnie needing tenderness and care.</p>
<p>Involved and fantastic as it may sound, I have the belief that
it was the mother instinct that took Rose off with Ronnie more
than love.&nbsp; What I mean is that she did not go with him as
most women go with men, through ordinary passion, but because he
was fragile and in need of protection and she thought of him as
her own, or&mdash;subconsciously of course&mdash;even as one of
those unborn sons which he himself would have begotten.&nbsp; So
mystical can women be!</p>
<p>But of course the wild hope of escape was present too: the
wish to live a little more fully while there was yet time; the
feeling that to endure another moment with Eustace was impossible
and wrong.</p>
<p>And again Theodore&rsquo;s wish came back to me.&nbsp; <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Was this
&ldquo;beating the band&rdquo;?&nbsp; Could anything be farther
from the ordinary conception of that successful and honourable
act than running off with another man and leaving husband and
child?&nbsp; And yet, it had required courage, devotion,
disregard of the world&rsquo;s censure&mdash;all the things that
properly-brought-up and even universally respected people need
not possess.&nbsp; What a muddle is our civilization!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must forgive this untimely and unprofessional
visit,&rdquo; I said, as I was shown into Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman&rsquo;s over-furnished sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Doctor,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have done with your politeness.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t I know why you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Rose.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
bolted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely the villagers aren&rsquo;t talking?&rdquo; I
said in a panic of alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to
say it&rsquo;s not a secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows but you and me,&rdquo; said the old
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Suzanne,&rdquo; I corrected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Suzanne!&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s an ally.&nbsp; But no one else knows.&nbsp; I know
because I had a letter to-day.&nbsp; Rose took me some way into
her confidence when she was staying with you.&nbsp; Old people
often get told things.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t worry; it&rsquo;s
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you mean?&nbsp; Do you want young wives to behave like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they&rsquo;re like Rose&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor lamb was miserable.&nbsp; That
iceberg of hers was no good except to freeze her.&nbsp; She wants
life, love, human emotions, and she&rsquo;ll get them with the
young Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; I exclaimed, aghast at this
Bolshevism.&nbsp; &ldquo;You talk as if people had the right to
do as they please&mdash;break laws&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all of them by any means, the idiots,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Rose&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Rose ought to
have all she wants.&nbsp; I advised her to.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s&mdash;no don&rsquo;t interrupt me&mdash;it&rsquo;s
your own doing very largely.&nbsp; You brought her up to be happy
and true to herself.&nbsp; She saw you always at work ministering
to other people&mdash;Oh! I know you were paid for
it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve paid you myself&mdash;money thrown away too,
for I only get worse&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter:
you&rsquo;re a soft old thing at heart.&nbsp; Anyway, there was
Rose, the apple of your eye, with a natural sweet disposition,
and the centre of your circle of friends, and the mistress of
your easy-going prosperous house, and she gets into kindly humane
habits.&nbsp; Then she marries this refrigerator K.C., or
whatever he is, and begins to miss everything that she had been
used to.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a stupid fellow&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t
even the sense to be ill and touch her heart that way&mdash;he
can&rsquo;t lose his temper&mdash;can&rsquo;t swear&mdash;only be
politely rasping now and then&mdash;and he gradually wore her
down, <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>diluted her sweetness, crushed her nice impulses, made
her live according to Cocker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderful, I thought, what a lot the old lady had divined, for
I&rsquo;m sure Rose never told her in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no doubt about his selfishness,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for selfishness,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that.&nbsp; That hasn&rsquo;t
necessarily anything to do with it.&nbsp; All the most attractive
men are selfish, even if the most selfish men are not the most
attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about the unselfish men you know and you&rsquo;ll
soon realize its truth,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unselfish men don&rsquo;t give us any fun at
all&mdash;I&rsquo;m talking as a woman, remember&mdash;they make
it too easy.&nbsp; The selfish ones keep us thinking, and when
they forget themselves it&rsquo;s delicious: I mean, it used to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sighed and laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s about Rose we&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having got rid for a while of her
husband, she comes down here and finds that poor boy, her old
friend, ill and miserable, and all the love she ought to have
felt for him years ago suddenly materialized, but a million times
stronger, and there you are.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bolt, my lamb,&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s what I said to her, although she never asked for my
advice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bolt, my lamb, and be happy while you
can.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re
damned.&nbsp; Nobody minds.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re not so damned
as <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>that
poor child would have been if she&rsquo;d gone back to the Arctic
Zone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m old enough to believe that the whole
purpose of unhappy people&rsquo;s lives is not endurance.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve seen too much of it.&nbsp; And so has every one,
especially you doctors.&nbsp; Endurance?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Let
revolt and escape have a chance too.&nbsp; That is, if people
really want them.&nbsp; The trouble is that really wanting things
is so rare.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lukewarm world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed that you
could dare to advise anything so revolutionary to Rose.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a terrible responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look at it differently,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty years older than you, and, being a woman,
perhaps I feel more bitterly for Rose.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;m a
rebel and you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a believer in cutting
knots, and you&mdash;although you&rsquo;re more sympathetic than
most&mdash;are still in favour of &lsquo;endurance
vile.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let those endure that enjoy it, say I, but let
the others try for a second innings and a happier.&nbsp; If Rose
had remained it would have been for what purpose?&nbsp; To pander
to her husband&rsquo;s respectability.&nbsp; Do you defend
that?&nbsp; Is that your idea of a sound motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything can be put up with,&rdquo; I said
feebly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ever since I began to practise I have been
watching couples putting up with bad jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And admiring them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way&mdash;yes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wanting the same kind of death-in-life for your own
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer that question, yes or no,&rdquo; she
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; I began again, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
the child.&nbsp; What about her?&nbsp; Left
motherless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what about Rose herself?&rdquo; Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was motherless and
fatherless too, and she grew into happiness and became a
beautiful woman, thanks in some degree to some one who shall be
nameless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;might possibly be
feeling not a little guilty over the way that things are turning
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who, if he did so,&rdquo; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman
added, &ldquo;would be a very silly old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hold me absolutely innocent then?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent of harm&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s not the harm you seem to
think.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s social shipwreck, of course, but
that&rsquo;s nothing, because they&rsquo;ll live abroad.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the Iceberg&rsquo;s grief, but that doesn&rsquo;t
matter because he was never really in love.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
little Rose&mdash;but she&rsquo;s only five and will adjust
herself.&nbsp; No, the only real sufferers will be the
Captain&rsquo;s father and mother, who, like all <i>nouveaux
riches</i>, were thinking of a grand match for him.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll be very sore, and not unnaturally.&nbsp; But the
world isn&rsquo;t for <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>fathers and mothers: it&rsquo;s for
sons and daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a cynical old woman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m ashamed of you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost sorry I&rsquo;ve
kept you alive so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;ve survived it&rsquo;s been in spite of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of Rose herself?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can this be any but harm to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s happy,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s happy now&mdash;to-day&mdash;and she&rsquo;s
going to be happier once she&rsquo;s on the sea, sailing away
with her boy to make a new home together.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got
something to squander herself on, and that&rsquo;s happiness,
even when the something isn&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her child?&rdquo; I returned to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her child will be all right, too.&nbsp; You&mdash;or
some one else&mdash;will bring her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it is so in Rose&rsquo;s
case,&rdquo; the ruthless old commentator added, &ldquo;but lots
of girls are better away from their mothers than with them, and
lots of mothers better away from their girls.&nbsp; Children
often enough would be the better if they were brought up by other
people and not their parents.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I should have
been.&nbsp; My mother and I were like Kilkenny cats most of the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To my intense surprise, who should arrive the next day but
Eustace, leading his little girl by the hand.&nbsp; I had
expected to hear from him; <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>but I had never thought to have him
again under my roof.&nbsp; Vaguely I had guessed that he might
associate me in some way with his wife&rsquo;s action; unjustly,
of course, but people are oftener unjust than not, and he was
wounded to the quick and in no position to be too fair and
reasonable.&nbsp; Besides, it was while Rose was visiting me that
she had met Ronnie again, and it was the news of his return and
illness in one of my letters to her that (I now saw) had
determined her to come just at that time on a visit to her early
home.&nbsp; I had touched an old chord and set it
vibrating.&nbsp; All this Eustace, I thought, knew, and I was
taking his resentfulness, however ill-founded, for granted.</p>
<p>But how often we are in error in our notion of what other
people are feeling!&nbsp; And how difficult it is to learn not to
continue to make such mistakes!&nbsp; Eustace was harbouring no
such grudge; he held me innocent; he even went so far as to
wonder, when we were alone, if he himself might not somehow have
been to blame.&nbsp; He could lay nothing specific to his charge;
and yet. . . .&nbsp; But no, it could not be through fault of his
own.&nbsp; Try as he might&mdash;and he had passed sleepless
nights in reviewing the past&mdash;he could not recall ever
having failed in any direction whatever in his duty as an
affectionate and solicitous husband.</p>
<p>The letter that Rose had left for him, he averred, when it
came to essentials, said nothing.&nbsp; He did not show it to me
but gave me the sense.&nbsp; It expressed sorrow at her failure
to make him a <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>worthy wife, regret at the collapse of their dream, and
then said that she was sure that when he thought it all over he
would understand, and, understanding, forgive.&nbsp; But if he
could not forgive he would forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget!&rdquo; Eustace exclaimed.&nbsp; How could he
forget?&nbsp; How could he ever forget?&nbsp; The shame of it
too.</p>
<p>But he must not inflict his misery on me.&nbsp; That would be
unfair, and I naturally had my own disappointment and grief to
dispel.</p>
<p>We were sitting over our tobacco, late&mdash;too late for me,
for I was very tired and the contemplation of spilt milk has
never much attracted me.&nbsp; Would I tell him, he asked, of my
own affairs?&nbsp; What was the health of the
neighbourhood?&nbsp; Good?&nbsp; All the same, I must agree that
it was extraordinary, incredible even, that his wife, the mother
of his child, should find it possible to do
this&mdash;this&mdash;he hated to be hard on her&mdash;but he was
bound to call it, this scandalous thing?&nbsp; To leave her home
in Wilton Place, one of the most charming and convenient houses
in London, every one said: to leave her circle of friends, hers
and his&mdash;was not that all amazing and beyond credence?&nbsp;
As for himself, he would say nothing, except that barristers, by
the very nature of their calling, are peculiarly in a position to
be protected by their wives rather than made by them to look
foolish if not despicable.&nbsp; How thankful he was that when he
was called to the Bar he had <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>decided to specialize and not take
up advocacy.&nbsp; The spectacle of a leading divorce court
counsel himself unable to retain his wife&rsquo;s affections
would be too ludicrous; his career would be finished.&nbsp; As it
was&mdash;but his mind was in a whirl on the whole question of
his future.</p>
<p>That I felt sorry for him as he laid bare his wounded ego, I
need not say.&nbsp; No one could have failed to pity him.&nbsp;
But to see him so blind to any but his own misfortune, so
incapable of putting himself for an instant into Rose&rsquo;s
place, or to realize that such a woman must have suffered much
and long before she could take such a step, was to withhold a
certain measure of sympathy.</p>
<p>He would not, he began again, inflict any more of his
perplexities on me.&nbsp; It was not that that he had come
for.&nbsp; Would I mind if he took the key and went for a
walk?&nbsp; He had no desire for bed and I must be weary.</p>
<p>I was rising to comply with this exceedingly welcome
suggestion when he began again.&nbsp; What was not the least
extraordinary part of the whole mystery, he said, was the
circumstance&mdash;mark this!&mdash;that Rose had never given the
faintest indication of unrest, dissatisfaction.&nbsp; How could
one account for it?&nbsp; It was not as if he had been cool or
careless or in the slightest respect neglectful.&nbsp; He taxed
his memory in vain in the attempt to collect a single
instance.&nbsp; As to his having given any of the ordinary causes
for jealousy that was laughably out of the question.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>He
laughed now, to illustrate the impossibility, and his hollow
travesty of mirth gave me deeper knowledge of the poor fellow
than all his words.&nbsp; If he had only known that such complete
failure to provide a wife with cause for jealousy is no surety of
married bliss.</p>
<p>None the less, he went on, guiltless as he held himself to be,
he could not keep at bay the suspicion, the reflection, that a
man is not deserted by his wife without some reason.&nbsp; What
it could be passed his comprehension, but he had the gnawing fear
that it existed.&nbsp; Could I offer any suggestion?&nbsp; I had
known Rose longer than anyone else, even though she was an
immature girl when she left me.</p>
<p>I said that there must of course be some reason.&nbsp; Was it
not possible&mdash;women are strange creatures&mdash;that Rose
needed something more than a good home, a circle of London
friends none of whom had she known before marriage,
unintermittent courtesy from her husband?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are not like us,&rdquo; I went on: &ldquo;women
are capricious&mdash;it is a commonplace of the dramatists and
novelists, who are supposed to know&mdash;look at Shakespeare,
Browning, Hardy, every one&mdash;they are capricious,
incalculable, they have odd whimsies, desires&mdash;every doctor
can tell you about them&mdash;they take sudden dislikes.&nbsp; In
short,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they are women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed heartily.</p>
<p>Some women, I continued, even actually <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>appreciate
a little bullying, a little roughness; some must be continually
re-wooed, taken on new honeymoons.&nbsp; The greatest mistake in
marriage can be the limitation of honeymoons to one.&nbsp; As for
Rose&mdash;he must remember that she was born and bred in the
country: her early days had been spent in gardens; perhaps she
was spoiling for the open air again.&nbsp; Oh, yes, I knew that
Wilton Place was near the Park; but I meant something more open
than that.&nbsp; She had a touch of the woods in her: something
of the dryad, even the naiad.&nbsp; Surely he had noticed
that?</p>
<p>No, he had not.&nbsp; I was thinking of her, doubtless, as a
child, and he had known her as a woman and a mother.&nbsp; I must
remember that.&nbsp; Nor could he quite agree that I had in the
least accounted for anything more than a sudden wish for a
holiday in the country.&nbsp; I had said nothing yet to explain
her physical treachery&mdash;her infidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have no theory to
propound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor had I.&nbsp; I would not have
propounded it for the world.</p>
<p>In that case, he said, he must fall back on what was at once
the kindest and the most plausible theory&mdash;that Rose had
lost her reason.&nbsp; Yes, that was it.&nbsp; Her mental balance
was disturbed, and in her derangement he had become antipathetic
to her, the author even of some imagined inconstancy; and in her
nervous, unhinged condition she reverted, perhaps subconsciously,
to her youthful days, and, thinking herself again the <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>playmate of
this boy, this soldier, she had automatically, as it were,
resumed friendship with him, and he had been base enough to take
advantage of her distraught state and had carried her off.&nbsp;
That, he felt sure, was the explanation; yes, that was it.</p>
<p>He fell into a long silence, but I had no hope.&nbsp; He had
now, I could see, given up all idea of his nocturnal walk.&nbsp;
Nor could any movement of my own&mdash;adjusting the shutters,
moving ashtrays, and so forth&mdash;deflect his thoughts.</p>
<p>What steps he intended to take, he went on, he could not
say.&nbsp; He had not decided.&nbsp; All that he had decided was
not to make the case public, and to go away.&nbsp; London had
become unbearable; he shrank equally from the spoken condolence
of his friends and from their tactful avoidance of the
subject.&nbsp; He had long wanted to visit the Argentine, where
his services were, as it chanced, in demand at the moment in
connexion with some big dispute, and in the future of which he
was a firm believer, and he should take this opportunity of
throwing some of his care on to the bosom of the sea, the great
simplifier.</p>
<p>But in order to do that with a comparatively assured mind Rose
must be left in good hands.</p>
<p>This brought him to the purpose of his visit, which he could
assure me had not been to force me to listen to his tale of woe
at all.&nbsp; Would I, to put it briefly, would I let him leave
Rose with me?&nbsp; He should feel absolutely at peace if I
would.&nbsp; There was no one else whom he could trust in <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>the same
way.&nbsp; He had many relations, it is true, but&mdash;well,
there it was.&nbsp; And somehow there was a kind of fitness in
it.&nbsp; I had brought up his own Rose, who was the most
beautiful creature he should ever meet&mdash;here he almost broke
down and I admired him for it&mdash;and, well, and&mdash;here he
broke down completely.</p>
<p>I confess to being deeply touched by the confidence implied in
his request; and I shivered as I remembered my unfounded
suspicion that he was likely to hold me to blame, at any rate in
part, for his tragedy.&nbsp; It seemed to me as high a compliment
as could be paid, that he, with his poor torn feelings and his
pride all in rags, should be willing to place his daughter under
the care of the man whose possible laxity had been responsible
for her mother&rsquo;s defection.</p>
<p>But the question would have to be considered very
thoroughly.&nbsp; The responsibility would be very great, nor was
I in some ways as well fitted to become a little girl&rsquo;s
foster-father as I had been, twenty years ago, when the other
Rose had come to me.&nbsp; I was then young enough to be an
active playmate and I was flexible.&nbsp; I had now become not
only older but a man of fixed habits, many of which would have to
be broken.&nbsp; Could I break them, and did I want to break
them?&nbsp; For Rose&rsquo;s child (could she have engineered so
complicated a business as having one without the assistance of
anyone else) I would do anything, but this was
Rose&rsquo;s-and-Eustace&rsquo;s child, and that made <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>so much
difference.&nbsp; I could be sorry for Eustace, but never could I
like him, and supposing that some of his least admirable
characteristics manifested themselves now and then in his
offspring, might I not become actively antipathetic?&nbsp; Human
nature can be so unreasonable, so unjust, and I pretended to no
immunity from illogical aversions.</p>
<p>Nor was I in any need of a constant companion.&nbsp; Since
Rose&rsquo;s marriage I had tended more and more to eremitical
consolations&mdash;to my prints and gardening&mdash;whenever my
patients permitted me.&nbsp; Nor was the personnel of the place
of the kind that it had been when Rose&rsquo;s mother had come
&ldquo;for good.&rdquo;&nbsp; In those days, as I have
told&mdash;and very likely told twice&mdash;I had old Hannah to
help me.&nbsp; But Hannah was now a rheumatically crippled
paying-guest at Lowestoft who could do nothing for me even if I
again lured her forth.&nbsp; And the march of progress had
established a cash chemist near enough to my rounds to lead me to
give up dispensing, and so there was no longer Wellicum for the
new Rose to help and hinder and besiege with questions.&nbsp; The
same march, in another department of its attack upon the goodness
and oldness of the days that are gone, had substituted a
motor-car for my horses and traps, and so there was also no groom
for Rose to help and hinder and besiege with questions.&nbsp;
There was a chauffeur, it is true, but a man who has to do with
machinery does not compare, as guide, philosopher and friend of
small inquiring <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>persons, with a man who has the care of horses.</p>
<p>A gardener I still had, though Briggs was dead; and
neighbours, among them Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman, now getting on in
years, but with all her faculties; and some kind of a spurious,
inferior Hannah could be obtained; and if Rose liked animals she
could be provided both with a pony and a boy to look after
it.&nbsp; None the less, it was a great problem and I had very
serious doubts; yet I knew I should say yes.&nbsp; And I should
say it with the more confidence because of Suzanne.&nbsp; Suzanne
was my sheet-anchor.&nbsp; It is true that I could not consider
her attitude to the elopement very sound: it was indeed far too
lenient; but I seemed to be surrounded by old women with advanced
sympathies (perhaps all old women at heart side with love&rsquo;s
rebels?), and Suzanne&rsquo;s profound affection for Rose&rsquo;s
mother could not but make her careful over the little girl.</p>
<p>But as we get older we become more self-protective; so I gave
no promise, but shook hands with Eustace and said that I would
think it all over and let him know in the morning what I
decided.&nbsp; Upon this promise he permitted me, to my great
joy, to go, at a very late hour to bed.&nbsp; My last waking
thought was one of satisfaction that he had not, at any rate,
said anything about band-beating.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If we are all to be arraigned at the Judgment <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Seat and
put finally in our places, why not wait till then?&nbsp; Let God
dispense favour and disfavour, rewards and punishments, that
being His <i>m&eacute;tier</i>, and meanwhile let me be
unjudicial and kind.&nbsp; That had been for so long my creed
that I was staggered when, not long after, Ronnie&rsquo;s father,
with whom I had been on amicable, neighbourly terms for years,
and with whose interior I was too intimately acquainted, cut me
dead in the post office.</p>
<p>The next afternoon her ladyship, Ronnie&rsquo;s mother, failed
to acknowledge my salutation, and I knew that my disgrace was
complete.&nbsp; Obviously it was I who was to blame for
Rose&rsquo;s wickedness.</p>
<p>That evening I received by hand a letter from Sir Edmund
stating that after what had happened it was the wish of himself
and his wife that I should never darken his door again.&nbsp; I
remember the phrase distinctly&mdash;never darken his door: he
must have carried it in his mind from a melodrama witnessed in
his youth.&nbsp; Much as they had esteemed me in the past, the
letter continued, and much even as they were indebted to me in my
capacity as a doctor, they could never forget that their poor
son&rsquo;s affections had been basely stolen&mdash;all ill and
weakened as he was&mdash;by a woman whom I had brought up.&nbsp;
They did not say that it was the direct effect of my loose
training, but that was the suggestion.&nbsp; Their hearts were
broken, their heads were abashed, and they had lost their only
child, the prop of their old age and declining <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>years, and
it could never have happened had not Rose been my ward and grown
up in my house, in that village, as a neighbour of their
own.&nbsp; Under the circumstances I must see that further
intercourse between them and me was an impossibility.&nbsp; And
the remark applied also to my assistant.&nbsp; The letter ended
with a request for my account.</p>
<p>My answer was chiefly an acknowledgment, but I could not
refrain from suggesting that while I had been bringing up the
girl who had run away with their Ronnie, they had been bringing
up the boy who had run away with my Rose.&nbsp; Were we not
equally bereaved and distressed and even ashamed, they and
I?&nbsp; But nothing but a cheque came in reply to this.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In due time I wrote to Eustace to say that I would take Rose
while he was away and do my best to preserve her sweetness.&nbsp;
And then I paid a visit to the wing of the house where Hannah had
reigned, to see what was needed.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I found Suzanne busy with a
polishing-cloth.</p>
<p>I asked her what she was doing there, so far from her own
domain.</p>
<p>It amused her, she said, to keep it bright and make it toute
pr&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>Toute pr&ecirc;te for what? I asked.</p>
<p>For la petite, she said.</p>
<p>But why should she do that? I asked, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>concealing
my astonishment.&nbsp; How could so young a child be coming to
live here, with all us old folks?</p>
<p>Suzanne resumed her polishing.&nbsp; It was in her heart, she
said, that the little Rose was to make her home here.&nbsp; It
was what her mother would have wished.</p>
<p>I never saw more pleasure written on the human countenance
than lighted up Suzanne&rsquo;s when I told her that she was
right.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman was naturally the first person whom I
officially told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was hoping you might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other critics won&rsquo;t be so well satisfied,&rdquo;
I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind them,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what an adoptive fellow you
are!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a regular creche!&nbsp; No children of
your own, O dear no!&mdash;nothing so vulgar as marrying and
begetting&mdash;but if anyone has a daughter going begging
you&rsquo;re the boy to bring it up!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
amazing.&nbsp; How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her.&nbsp; And I may as well tell every one: when Rose
the second came to me for good I was fifty-six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-six!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The prime of
life.&nbsp; Uphill till you&rsquo;re fifty; then the top of the
hill till you&rsquo;re sixty; then the steady decline.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a foolish world, Doctor; there&rsquo;s no steadiness
in it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re always hurrying to the churchyard: <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>some of us
unassisted, others being pushed by our medical men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her that that was too old a joke for her to
crack.&nbsp; We looked to her for something original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old jokes are best,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
any rate, there&rsquo;s something very sound in that old one
about the advantage of adopting a child rather than having one of
your own.&nbsp; Those, it says, who adopt choose, whereas those
who have a child in the ordinary manner must put up with what
they get.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re one of the clever ones, Doctor; you
choose.&nbsp; And may Rose the second turn out as pretty and as
sweet as that other one!&nbsp; Bring her to me quickly.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no time to waste; when one is nearly eighty one
can&rsquo;t postpone.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Little Rose quickly became a comfort, and she was like enough
to her mother for me to feel that a benign miracle had been
performed and the clock set back twenty years.&nbsp; It is given
to few persons to enjoy a second time on earth, and I think of
myself as peculiarly fortunate in having twice been the most
intimate companion of a child.&nbsp; For my first Rose, I shall
always have, I imagine, the tenderer spot; but the second Rose
did perhaps more to cheer me, for I was much older when Eustace
left her in my charge, and she helped to keep me young.&nbsp; It
is possible that but for her mother I might have made more of a
life of my own, and even, it is possible, have <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>been the
father of Roses.&nbsp; No one can tell&mdash;nor am I suggesting
resentment or even disappointment.&nbsp; I am probably better
qualified to bring up other people&rsquo;s children than my own,
and the world is over- rather than under-populated.&nbsp; But the
Devil&rsquo;s advocate, who thought of this possible count
against the first Rose, would be hopelessly dumb when called upon
to indict the second.</p>
<p>The second Rose was a more active child than her mother had
been&mdash;not restless but alert&mdash;and there was little that
did not interest her.&nbsp; Her mother had made her own
entertainment, but this Rose found most of hers in the visible
world.&nbsp; Nothing escaped her notice.</p>
<p>In the excitement of her new life she did not miss her mother
with any poignancy, and seemed to be satisfied with the
explanation of her absence that she had gone across the
sea.&nbsp; This was true.&nbsp; Ronnie had left the army and he
and Rose were on their way to the Malay States, where he was to
grow rubber.&nbsp; As for Eustace, the child never mentioned him
at all.&nbsp; He had been one of those fathers who are seen only
at breakfast and on Sundays.</p>
<p>Until a nurse was found&mdash;the Wilton Place nurse having
refused to live in the country so far from the Knightsbridge
barracks&mdash;Rose had a bed in my dressing-room.</p>
<p>One of her timidities was concerned with moths.&nbsp; For some
odd reason those foolish gentle insects, who have never been
known to harm anyone but themselves, terrified her, and often and
often she <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>would wake me in the night with the cry,
&ldquo;Dombeen, there&rsquo;s a mawf in the room!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Come quick, Dombeen, there&rsquo;s a little mawf
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grew out of her fears, of course, and in time occupied a
more distant apartment; but for a long while I rarely got through
the night without some such call&mdash;the little monkey even
employing it as an appeal when there was no danger, as the boy
called &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo; in the fable.&nbsp; But no
matter how suspicious I may have been, I always went.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dombeen, Dombeen, there&rsquo;s a mawf in the
room&rdquo;&mdash;how I wish I could hear that now!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Little Mawf&rdquo; became one of my names for her.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was with the new Rose as with the old: my patients were
intensely interested in her.&nbsp; Not many, however, were the
same as those who had been so solicitous about her mother.&nbsp;
Some had left the neighbourhood; some preferred my assistant;
some were dead.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman was, I think,
Rose&rsquo;s favourite, in spite of the years between
them&mdash;the old lady now nearing the eighties and the child
not yet six.&nbsp; Seventy years is a big dividing gulf, and yet
when they were together there was little sign of it, such was the
adaptability of both.</p>
<p>The first time that I took Rose to tea, Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman
gave her two presents&mdash;a fearsome agate brooch (she had an
early Victorian taste in ornaments) and a paint-box that had been
her <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>companion on sketching rambles when she was
active.&nbsp; It was one of the old-fashioned boxes, with the
colours in cakes and a drawer underneath with a porcelain palette
in it and many fascinating accessories.&nbsp; The agate might as
well have been thrown into the river, but the paint-box was a
treasure beyond price, and it played a great part in Rose&rsquo;s
destiny, for it turned her thoughts to art, and some of her
grandfather&rsquo;s skill soon began to manifest itself.</p>
<p>Having this resource, Rose needed less entertaining than any
child I ever knew.&nbsp; Give her a pencil and a piece of paper
and she would be happy until the paper was covered on both
sides.&nbsp; It is odd that her mother had no desire to draw and
no aptitude: that the talent should skip a generation and
manifest itself again in Theodore&rsquo;s grandchild; but so it
was.&nbsp; Rose the elder had beguiled her loneliness by telling
herself stories; Rose the younger scribbled men and women and
little girls and little boys and dogs and huntsmen and princesses
and cats on the blank spaces of letters and the insides of
envelopes or whatever scraps of paper could be found, from morn
till dewy eve.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Ronnie&rsquo;s people took too much delight in illness to be
happy in their aloofness from me.&nbsp; Disregarding a certain
solidarity in the medical profession, they had assumed that Dr.
Vaughan in the next town would be only too willing to obey their
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>capricious summonses whenever the slightest pain made
itself felt in either of their systems.&nbsp; But Vaughan was a
friend of mine by no means desirous of supplanting me anywhere or
of getting a footing in the Hall.&nbsp; He therefore refused to
go.&nbsp; Doctors, it is notorious, must obey calls of distress
or bear the consequences, but not when other doctors are nearer,
and, as he knew why I was not called and knew also that Sir
Edmund and Lady Fergusson knew that he knew why I was not called,
he was in a very strong position&mdash;strengthened by the
alliance of the telephone, which enabled him to make quite sure
of his ground.&nbsp; Most telephone wires, could they be induced
to repeat all that they have ever transmitted, would have some
odd things to tell, and the conversations between Vaughan and
myself while this feud was flourishing would not be least
amusing.&nbsp; We had the great advantage of having been
contemporaries at the same hospital, and it is, at bottom, only
contemporaries who really understand each other.&nbsp; Old and
young may meet, but contemporaries mingle.</p>
<p>In the face of the confederacy between Vaughan and myself the
unhappy Fergussons, racked with gout, were forced to send for
Vaughan&rsquo;s rival, a young bumptious and climbing
practitioner who had just set up in the place and was pulling
every wire for social advancement, but who, for all his latest
learning and diplomas, was wanting in the most important quality
that a medical attendant <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>can possess, the power to suggest
confidence.&nbsp; There are patients who would languish under the
care of the most brilliant physician in the world lacking the
gift, and who would recover quickly though only a farrier,
possessing it, should stand beside their bed.&nbsp; Sir Edmund
and Lady Fergusson were therefore very awkwardly placed.</p>
<p>Their next step was really rather Napoleonic and made Sir
Edmund&rsquo;s rise to wealth clear to me.&nbsp; They determined
to bring down a new doctor who should be both agreeable to them
and capable as a healer and establish him in our very village,
not only as a constant attendant upon themselves, but as a menace
and source of annoyance, and even loss, to me.&nbsp; But here
they were baulked by the goodness of my friends.&nbsp; One cannot
be a doctor in the same rural neighbourhood all one&rsquo;s life,
and succeed a father who also had been there for years and years,
without setting up certain relationships that are thicker than
water.&nbsp; I had made no effort to do so, but simply through
being one&rsquo;s more or less amiable self, and liking my work
rather than not, I had done so.&nbsp; If I had consciously toiled
to be popular, I might have failed; but I had just gone on my
way, neglected no one, at any rate not scandalously, spoken my
mind when it was asked for, and hurried, I hope and believe, very
few of my neighbours under the turf.&nbsp; To have built up this
structure of friendliness was my part in the frustration of Sir
Edmund&rsquo;s masterful campaign.&nbsp; His own contribution to
his failure <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>was his neglect to have become the owner of any
property in the district except the Hall and its satellite
cottages.&nbsp; The result was that when his nominee tried to
rent a house in which to set up his rival practice, he could not
get one.&nbsp; Anybody else could have had one&mdash;an avowed
burglar even, with all his tools about him&mdash;but not a
doctor!</p>
<p>The situation was not made any easier for the Fergussons by
the palpitations of their cook&mdash;a very excellent
cook&mdash;who, on being forbidden to visit me about her malady,
at once gave notice.&nbsp; If she might not have the doctor she
wished, she explained, she should certainly leave.&nbsp; Nor
would she stay out the month either, she added, but would
cheerfully forfeit her wages in order that she might the sooner
submit her agitated heart to my examination.&nbsp; Good cooks
having never grown on blackberry bushes, and this one being
especially clever with chicken&rsquo;s livers (one of Sir
Edmund&rsquo;s many culinary weaknesses), her departure was a
very serious blow to him, in a very sensitive part.</p>
<p>To say that Sir Edmund and Lady Fergusson&rsquo;s aches and
twinges multiplied under their disappointments is to state the
case with parsimony.&nbsp; They increased to such an extent that
the two old coddlers saw graves yawning for them on every hand,
and longed with a consuming longing&mdash;which was not the less
because each had to hide it from the other for pride&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;for the solicitude and knowledge of the only man who
knew them through and through&mdash;a longing so constantly <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>consuming
that there was nothing for it but to go to London or to fly the
flag of truce.&nbsp; They hated London, but to capitulate was too
undignified; and so for a while the Hall was empty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By what chance the news of Rose&rsquo;s flight reached Mrs.
Stratton I have no notion.&nbsp; But in course of time she heard
it, and I hardly need say did not deprive me of an opportunity of
learning what her feelings were.&nbsp; I cannot give the exact
words of her letter, because I tore it up quickly, but its spirit
remains with me.</p>
<p>It was largely a fantasia of triumph on the motif &ldquo;I
told you so.&rdquo;&nbsp; What could be expected, it asked
scornfully, of such a bringing-up as the poor girl had had?&nbsp;
When children are handed over to cynical and irreverent bachelors
we must look for trouble.&nbsp; What chance had Rose of living a
sound life after so much careless familiarity with me and my
friends?&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; It all pointed to the importance
of steady self-sacrificing home-training.&nbsp; We might sneer at
the old-fashioned ways as much as we liked, but they were the
best, after all.&nbsp; Her own girls, Mrs. Stratton was thankful
to say, had been brought up to respect religion and do their
duty, but their training had made no difference to their natural
brightness and joy.&nbsp; It was not necessary to be superior to
conventionality in order to be gay!</p>
<p>Poor Milly Stratton!&nbsp; What a Benjamin&rsquo;s <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>portion of
humble-pie was hers not long after, and how careful we should be
to discourage tendencies to self-righteousness!&nbsp; If there is
a good little cherub that sits up aloft filled with benevolent
protectiveness for the simple sailor-man, there is no less surely
a mischievous little imp, infinitely more watchful, whose mission
in life is to detect the complacently virtuous and make things
hot for them.&nbsp; Milly Stratton came very quickly within his
sphere of action, poor woman.</p>
<p>Driving up the road just before lunch I saw a strange figure
in the garden and was instantaneously conscious that she was
unhappy.&nbsp; Why the set of the shoulders, the movement of the
arms, of an unknown visitor seen among rose bushes at a
considerable distance, should convey an impression of mental
disorder, I cannot explain; nor am I a particularly good
observer.&nbsp; All I can say is that in a flash I received the
suggestion; and, as it happened, it was right.</p>
<p>On reaching the house I found that the stranger was Mrs.
Stratton, who turned a distraught face to me as I approached
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Greville,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am come both to
ask your forgiveness and your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgiveness?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, forgiveness.&nbsp; I was very hard on you many
years ago, in that room there, on the night of the reading of
poor Theodore&rsquo;s will, and I was very hard on you the other
day in a letter which I wrote about Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I assured her,
adding that she certainly had had provocation on the first
occasion, and no doubt also I was not very nice to her.&nbsp; I
was younger then and perhaps too assertive: perhaps rather
offensively proud of being selected by Theodore as his
daughter&rsquo;s guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
one was horrid but myself.&nbsp; I was proud and
self-righteous.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; she added brokenly, &ldquo;I
have been punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to cry and I led her into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me after we have had lunch,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must be tired and hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said that she could eat nothing, and was as good as her
word.</p>
<p>Throughout the meal she looked miserably, and yet with a kind
of fierce wistfulness, at little Rose, who did not know in the
least what to make of it&mdash;why this stranger should be here
at all, why the tears rolled down her cheeks with no accompanying
uproar, why she refused such delicious cheese-cakes.</p>
<p>A more uncomfortable meal I never ate, and all the while I was
speculating as to what had happened.&nbsp; Could the placid
George have revolted at last and left her?&nbsp; But that was
impossible.&nbsp; Had he been speculating and come to
disaster?&nbsp; More likely.</p>
<p>When we were left alone the story burst forth.&nbsp; It was
not George.&nbsp; In a way it was worse, more damaging to her
pride: it was her youngest daughter Angelica.&nbsp; Angelica,
aged only twenty, and not even engaged, was going to have a
baby.</p>
<p>O these babies!&nbsp; All the troubles and <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>complications of the world come from them.&nbsp; If
only they could be eliminated the globe would gradually fall back
into a permanent peaceful wilderness.&nbsp; That was perhaps my
thought during the silence that followed her announcement.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; was all that I could think to
say: said, I hope, with a note of sympathy to balance the
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you,&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton resumed,
&ldquo;because poor George is so helpless, and you are a doctor
and, I trust, in spite of my behaviour to you, a friend of the
family&mdash;almost, in a way, one of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time to repudiate the second suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So carefully brought up as she has been!&rdquo; the
mother went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo;
she added quickly, probably recalling her letter to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The thing now is to see what can be done?&nbsp; You will
help, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You must know of some place in Paris
where she could go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odd how all doctors are supposed to know this, and odder,
perhaps, how naturally even the most insular and irreconcilable
of the censors of France turn in these times of despair to that
deplorable country!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you need not exile the girl?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scandal would be bound to leak out at home,&rdquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, there are her sisters to think
of.&nbsp; They must not be contaminated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp; Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;Where is Angelica now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is still with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should imagine that her
sisters do know.&nbsp; And in any case, why contamination?&nbsp;
They need not be corrupted by the knowledge.&nbsp; It might make
them the more understanding, the more merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you blame her?&rdquo; Mrs. Stratton asked,
as a kind of challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I blame her&mdash;yes,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think she has been foolish: she has wronged herself and you; she
has flung away treasures of pride.&nbsp; But you must remember
that I don&rsquo;t know her; I have no idea of the strength of
her temptation; and in any case I cannot consider everything
lost.&nbsp; The error is not irreparable.&nbsp; It is according
to Nature.&nbsp; At its worst, apart from a criminal want of
prudence, it is but an anticipation of a ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think we should condone it?&nbsp; Keep her
among us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within touch, most certainly,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t exile her.&nbsp; This is when she wants
kindness more than at any time in her life&mdash;this is when you
have your first real opportunity to be her mother.&nbsp; You
ought to jump at it instead of suddenly freezing into a
judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must exercise a little discretion, of course,
and do all you can to preserve her good name.&nbsp; Many a family
has been confronted with the same problem and carried it off with
success.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>I had it in my mind to add that if
no cupboard held a worse skeleton than an unlegalized baby there
would not be much wrong with the world; but I refrained.&nbsp; I
refrained also from reminding her of the line in
&ldquo;Lear&rdquo;, &ldquo;The gods stand up for
bastards.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Stratton could not have understood,
nor was she in the mood for any levity.&nbsp; Indeed, I was
perplexing her sufficiently, all unready as she was for such
novel ideas as I had been unfolding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Stratton say?&rdquo; I was moved to ask, to
break her silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George?&mdash;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t know about it.&nbsp; I
wanted to see you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell him,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that he will agree with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come back with me?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would all be so much easier if you
would.&nbsp; Angelica might tell you things that she won&rsquo;t
tell me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean the man&rsquo;s name&mdash;no
one could get that from her.&nbsp; I am sure you could
help.&nbsp; It would be such a load off my mind if you would
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I had of course to comply.</p>
<p>I could not leave instantly, and while I was making the
preparations I was amused to see, out of the window, Mrs.
Stratton stealthily approaching the kitchen door.&nbsp; She knew
that Suzanne ruled there, and her mind had by no means
relinquished France as an ally!</p>
<p>I discovered afterwards that my guess had been <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>right.&nbsp; But Suzanne had as little practical
sympathy as Mrs. Stratton had colloquial French, and the
interview was a complete failure.&nbsp; There are delicacies of
situation beyond Ollendorff&rsquo;s range.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Stratton assured me once on the journey, she assured
me thirty times, that she would never be able to hold up her head
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I replied; and I was right.&nbsp; She
is holding it fairly high still, but with far less self-righteous
aloofness.&nbsp; Angelica&rsquo;s illicit bantling, whose
existence we were able to conceal from the world, did more to
humanize its grandmother than anything else could have
done.&nbsp; As for Angelica, she is now married and a respected
matron, with sons and daughters born in as lawful a form of
wedlock as Church and State can provide.</p>
<p>But that has nothing to do with my story, and I apologize for
the digression.&nbsp; My reconciliation with the Fergussons also
is not precisely in the direct line of this narrative, but having
described the earlier stages of the coolness, I must be permitted
to record the later.</p>
<p>Coming back along the Lowcester road one afternoon, I found a
big car at such an angle across it that it could not be passed;
and on approaching closer I discovered it to be the
Fergussons&rsquo;, with Lady Fergusson inside.&nbsp; So they had
returned!&nbsp; I had become accustomed to looking fixedly in
front of me when we had chanced to meet before they took refuge
in town; but the present situation would have rendered such a <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>man&oelig;uvre impossible, even if, directly I pulled
up, the Fergussons&rsquo; chauffeur had not come to ask if I
would do her Ladyship the kindness of speaking to her for a
moment.</p>
<p>I went to the door and she extended her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come in for a few moments,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want very much to speak to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here she
groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; I began.&nbsp; There was something
very offensive, after being cast off as I had been, in the
assumption that I should be ready to be taken on again whenever
the relenting mood occurred to them.&nbsp; Nor had I shaken her
hand.</p>
<p>She burst forthwith into tears and I entered the car.&nbsp; I
could not (as she knew) allow her to make an exhibition of
herself at the window, with the chauffeur looking on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Greville,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am a very
miserable woman.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be hard on me.&nbsp; I have
been punished enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; She groaned again, among the
sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me as quickly as possible,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to get on.&nbsp; My rounds are not finished
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would come back this way,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I intercepted you.&nbsp; It is so little that I am
able to do alone.&nbsp; That letter, now&mdash;it was not my
letter, I did not wish it, it was Sir Edmund&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Sir
Edmund was implacable, but I&mdash;I knew that blame cannot be
cast like that, just on one, and Ronnie was so fascinating, how
could a girl help falling in love with him?&nbsp; But Sir Edmund
could not see it.&nbsp; All he could see was Rose as a temptress
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>and the
ruin of his son and his name.&nbsp; You know how I have to give
way to him?&nbsp; Believe me, I have regretted it ever since, and
nothing but very wicked pride&mdash;we were always so proud, we
Ancasters&mdash;has kept me from trying to see you sooner.&nbsp;
But now my pride is humbled.&nbsp; Poor Sir Edmund&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what he would say if he knew I was talking to
you like this&mdash;poor Sir Edmund is ill, and you must forgive
us for his sake.&nbsp; Say you will.&nbsp; No doctor but you
inspires any confidence.&nbsp; We have tried so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgave you long ago,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will come to the Hall again?&nbsp;
Quickly?&nbsp; Will you?&nbsp; Sir Edmund is ill.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what it is, but something grave, something new
and mysterious.&nbsp; Never mind about me&rdquo;&mdash;she
groaned again&mdash;&ldquo;but he, poor darling! he must be
looked after, he must be healed.&nbsp; You will do this for my
sake?&nbsp; You will come to us again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think about it,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not quite as simple as you seem to suppose.&nbsp; I have been
very oddly treated in a very public manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she cried, as I
returned to my car.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have such a good heart and I
am so penitent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening I was sitting over my cigar after
dinner&mdash;Rose having gone to bed&mdash;when the servant
announced a gentleman to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo; I asked, for I was enjoying some
well-earned repose, and indiscriminate callers had to be guarded
against; but before she could <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>reply a muffled-up figure was in the
room.&nbsp; Removing his scarf, cap and goggles, he revealed
himself as Sir Edmund Fergusson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse this visit,&rdquo; he began nervously,
&ldquo;after what has happened, but it has been on my mind for a
long while to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he replied, taking a seat,
while a spasm of pain crossed his heavy features.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The fact is&mdash;but that has nothing to do with
it.&nbsp; What I want to do is to explain.&nbsp; This unhappy
business of Ronnie has broken us up, but I want you to
know&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke off and again a twinge took
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind if I were to light my pipe?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>I offered him cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; he said, taking one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;More than I deserve really.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;he lit it&mdash;&ldquo;you, well, the
best way I can put it is perhaps to say you are not a married
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not being married, you, well&mdash;in point of
fact, you can&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; A man, especially as he gets on
in years, has to make concessions to his wife.&nbsp; All life is
compromise, as you know, and married life in particular.&nbsp; A
certain happiness, or, at any rate, peace, must be secured, and
compromise is the highroad to it&mdash;in fact, the only
road.&nbsp; But it is absurd for me to be saying all this,
because of course you know Lady Fergusson.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>I
knew her well, but I knew also that in that <i>m&eacute;nage</i>
the grey mare was not the better animal; it was Sir Edmund who
ruled, and any compromise that was made came from his
wife&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>He may suddenly have been aware that some such thoughts were
passing in my mind, for he added, not without a slight flush,
&ldquo;Of course, you have not seen her lately&rdquo;&mdash;as
though during the few months of our estrangement both her
character and his own had undergone one of those changes that
happen only in tracts and fairy tales.&nbsp; He even had the
hardihood to add, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice a great difference
when,&rdquo; but stumbled over it and went on
quickly&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if you ever honour us by your
company again, as I most cordially hope you will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; he continued more fluently, &ldquo;it is
about that that I have come; about that, and our letter to you,
which I have been regretting ever since it was sent.&nbsp; What I
want to make clear&mdash;without any disloyalty, mind, to Lady
Fergusson&mdash;is that that letter was written when we were in a
highly nervous state and was written almost wholly at her
Ladyship&rsquo;s wish.&nbsp; You recall what I said about
compromise?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my dear
Greville, if you will permit me to call you that once
more&mdash;for the sake of harmony, for the sake of that peace
which must dominate a home, I consented to write that letter and
to do many other things which were a natural consequence of
it.&nbsp; When your reply came, I recognized the good <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>sense of it
at once; I knew, as any man of the world must know, that my poor
boy cannot be wholly absolved, that it takes two to make an
elopement no less than a marriage.&nbsp; I knew&mdash;but women
have not our penetration and common reasonableness, our sagacity,
shall I say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Fergusson,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;could not
take that view, and compromise made me, in that moment of stress
and disaster, when the Hall and all it stood for seemed to be
toppling about us like a house of cards, compromise made me as
wax in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come now, in humility and shame, to apologize
for my share of this most lamentable quarrel, and to ask you, for
the sake of my poor wife, to overlook it, to forget it, and once
more to show your magnanimity by coming to the Hall and doing
something to relieve that poor distraught creature&rsquo;s
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask nothing for myself,&rdquo; he concluded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I merely grovel.&nbsp; But for her sake you will come,
won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; No one knows her symptoms as you do.&nbsp;
In no one has she such confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had listened to the harangue without a word, but not without
many thoughts.&nbsp; Chiefly had I been wondering if husband and
wife were in collusion, or if they were really acting
independently.&nbsp; To this day I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As he came to an end, he advanced to me with an extended hand,
which I took.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come to the Hall to-morrow,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;But I should like as much publicity to be given
to your new friendly attitude as to the hostile one now
terminating.&nbsp; I count on you to let others know, as well as
myself, that you have reason to be ashamed of your conduct
towards me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must leave that to you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I was relieved that the hatchet was buried, not because I had
been incommoded by the feud to any great extent, but quarrels are
not in my line, and this one was uncomfortable to the
village.&nbsp; More than uncomfortable: degrading.</p>
<p>It was humiliating, for example, to one who would wish every
one to be dependent and honest, to see the embarrassment into
which some of my neighbours could be plunged when I had come
suddenly upon them while they were talking with Sir Edmund or
Lady Fergusson.&nbsp; They had to decide in a moment which side
to be on, whether to acknowledge me or not.&nbsp; I was, of
course, in the long run, of infinitely more use to them than the
Hall people could be: but wealth is wealth, and position is
position, and poor human nature is poor human nature and ever
will be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect it to change, but I cannot
bear to be a cause of plunging it into its less admirable
moods.</p>
<p>Our community was too small for the Hall people and the doctor
to be at enmity; and a large part of a country doctor&rsquo;s
duty is to act as cement, a fuser of classes, and while the
vendetta held how could I be this?</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>But
if a sigh of relief went up when it was known that I had been
seen to drive into the Hall gates again, no one emitted it with
more genuine heartiness than the rector, who had been put in a
peculiarly awkward position.&nbsp; For although my friend of many
years&rsquo; standing, he had not, poor fellow, enough courage to
take any stand in the matter.&nbsp; I am not blaming him.&nbsp;
The church does not train men to take a very strong stand on such
occasions, nor indeed require recruits from the ranks of the
independent and outspoken.&nbsp; Clerics, it is true, can become
approximately courageous and frank, but preferment usually
precedes the operation.&nbsp; Your country rector or vicar keeps
himself as free from trouble as possible&mdash;very
wisely&mdash;and listens to all sides even if he is not a
partisan of all sides.</p>
<p>The Fergussons were too important for our rector even to
contemplate the risk of losing them.&nbsp; So far as his church
was concerned, he was safe, as I was not an attendant; but I was
on this committee and that with both Sir Edmund and himself; we
were all three of us governors of the almshouses.&nbsp; I had
brought the rector&rsquo;s numerous children into the world; I
was even godfather to one of them.&nbsp; The rector was
continually coming to me for advice.&nbsp; My usefulness was as
necessary to him, or at any rate as comforting, as the
Hall&rsquo;s prestige, patronage and port.</p>
<p>Both of us he had, of course, held reprehensible in a very
high degree for the effect on his <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>parishioners of the defiance of
morality involved in Ronnie and Rose&rsquo;s escapade.&nbsp; He
blamed the Fergussons for providing a Ronnie, and me for my
association, although so vicarious, with Rose.&nbsp; How could he
expect his simple flock to keep in the straight path, he asked,
if the seventh commandment was treated with such contempt by the
sons and daughters of the rich and exalted?&nbsp; He felt that
his stewardship was under a cloud, even though Ronnie was merely
a visitor among us from India and Rose from Wilton Place.&nbsp;
Both had been children under him, when he was young and far more
energetic than now.&nbsp; If they had weakened and fallen, was it
not a reflection on his own zeal?</p>
<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman told me something of the good man&rsquo;s
line of self-torturing argument when I called on her one day, for
he did not himself dare to present the case to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think the old fellow&rsquo;s saying
now?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s saying that if any
of the husbands and wives in his congregation&mdash;Joe Smithers,
for example, and Alice Leith&mdash;were to bolt together for the
bad motive, he&rsquo;d have not a word to reply to them if they
were to say they did it because Captain Fergusson and Mrs. Holt
had made a break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rubbish! my dear sir,&rsquo; I said to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;People don&rsquo;t argue like that; at least
not honestly: only for effect.&nbsp; And people don&rsquo;t wait
for examples; they do what they want if they have the courage,
but for the most part they do nothing at all, because
they&rsquo;re cowards.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;It takes more courage, I told him, to do what
Captain Fergusson and Mrs. Holt have done than to resist
temptations; and my own belief is that no temptation worth the
name ever is resisted.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only resisted when
it&rsquo;s pretending to be strong.&nbsp; Passion isn&rsquo;t
resisted; but mercifully there&rsquo;s very little of it in
England.&nbsp; What we call passion is usually a mixture of a
certain amount of loneliness and a certain amount of curiosity
and a certain amount of appetite and a tremendous desire to
escape from what one is doing and have an adventure.&nbsp; But
passion, burning hot and self-sacrificing&mdash;there&rsquo;s
very little!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rector,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;actually had the
nerve to congratulate himself on the good conduct of the
parish.&nbsp; He seemed to think it&rsquo;s due to his
sermons.&nbsp; I put him right.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear man,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not your sermons; it&rsquo;s the want
of opportunity.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so uncompromising, Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you put into
speech what other people only dare to think, and sometimes not
even that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great privilege to be
Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;all I hope is that that
poor child of yours is happier with her soldier than she ever was
with her solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrister,&rdquo; I corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrister,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew he was
a barrister but I wanted to be alliterative.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
forget that my father was a scholar and a poet, and he taught us
to make phrases.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Rose&mdash;the older Rose&mdash;used to write
regularly.&nbsp; They were living at Kwala Lumpur, in the Straits
Settlements, and Ronnie was doing well with rubber.&nbsp; He
would never be really strong again, but they seemed to be
happy.&nbsp; I wrote regularly in reply and sent news of Rose the
less, whose perplexity about her mother&rsquo;s disappearance and
the change of home was no longer acute.&nbsp; In the first
instance Eustace had told her that her mother had gone away
across the sea, and left it vaguely there.&nbsp; To a child of
five such voyages may seem natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What message shall I give to your mother?&rdquo; I
wanted to ask, but I never did; nor did Rose send any message to
her daughter.&nbsp; It seemed better to let the tie relax and
gradually cease to be.&nbsp; Rose was never one to ask for things
&ldquo;both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eustace meanwhile was still in the Argentine, and it was three
years before he returned to England.&nbsp; His work at Buenos
Aires had led to various profitable ventures into which he had
been glad to throw himself as he shrank more and more from the
idea of resuming life in London.&nbsp; The house in Wilton Place
being let furnished at a high rent, and Rose being safe with me,
why should he return?&nbsp; The hymnist may ask, with an outraged
wonderment in his voice, &ldquo;Can a mother&rsquo;s tender care
cease towards the child she bare?&rdquo; but my experience is
that it can do so quite easily.&nbsp; I have watched it in the
process.&nbsp; As for a father&rsquo;s <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>tender care
for the child he engendered, that often never begins to exist at
all.&nbsp; Eustace, at any rate, endured separation from his
daughter with exemplary fortitude.</p>
<p>At the end of three years he was ready, however, to face the
music again, and a letter arrived saying that he would come down
for the week-end to see Rose and talk things over.</p>
<p>He duly arrived, very grey, but looking strong and hard and
handsome.&nbsp; He watched Rose very carefully at lunch, but
seemed to have no wish to be alone with her&mdash;almost a fear
that he might have to be.&nbsp; Rose studied him gravely, too,
but merely answered his questions and volunteered nothing.&nbsp;
I have had all my life only one rule of conduct with regard to
children, and that is to treat them as if they were grown up; I
ask their advice, consult with them, even conspire; and great has
been my reward in consequence.&nbsp; But Eustace was one of those
men who too consciously come down a peg or two with the young,
and Rose was made uneasy.&nbsp; She disappointed him by her
ignorance of the Argentine and expressed no interest when her
father told her that in sailors&rsquo; language Buenos Aires
became Bows and Arrows.</p>
<p>I had been troubled by the fear that he would want to take
Rose away and try the experiment of being a father to her: but it
was a false alarm.&nbsp; Once again I had been guilty of the
folly of anticipating disaster&mdash;a foible to which human
nature is ever too prone.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Eustace had many plans, but they did not embrace any
intimate association with his flesh and blood.&nbsp; Having
satisfied himself of my genuine desire to keep Rose, he told me
some of them.&nbsp; He was selling most of the Wilton Place
furniture, keeping only enough for a small service flat.&nbsp; He
would spend most of his week-ends in the Dormy House at
Bellingdon (what golf and tobacco can do for bachelors, widowers
and the separated, no pen can ever compute!), but would like to
come down to me occasionally, if I had no objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am the best companion for a child
of Rose&rsquo;s age,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;When she is
older I hope that she may come and live with me, but just now I
am both unsettled and unhappy and I should not be able to give
her sufficient attention.&nbsp; She should go to school, I think,
and then part at least of the holidays&mdash;the summer
holidays&mdash;she and I could spend together by the sea.&nbsp; I
might do a little sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the other Rose he said nothing.&nbsp; Nor did I mention
her.&nbsp; But Rose the less was like enough to her mother (her
double in expression, in certain moods) for him inevitably to
have her in his thoughts whenever the child was present.&nbsp;
Except at meals, however, she was careful to be absent.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Meanwhile Rose was growing up.&nbsp; When Eustace returned she
was eight and I did not want <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>better company.&nbsp; In herself she
was interesting, and it was interesting also to compare her with
her mother at the same age: I almost felt sometimes as if both
were present.&nbsp; She was more with me than the other Rose had
been, for I was now less often out and away, having a younger man
to take the harder work: and when I was away it was for shorter
periods because the car was so much swifter than poor old
Silver.&nbsp; Another reason was that this Rose was less friendly
with the neighbours: not because of any natural shyness, but
because she did not receive the same quality of welcome.&nbsp;
The little Rose of twenty years earlier, whose father had died
suddenly, was more acceptable than the little Rose of to-day,
whose mother had run away from husband and child with another
man&mdash;and that man the heir to the Hall.&nbsp; We are often
not logical in our censorious moods; and one of the last things
to go, in the decay of feudalism, will be respect for the Great
House.&nbsp; No one was so mean or courageous as to refuse
Rose&rsquo;s acquaintance; but she must have felt instinctively
that she was a little under a cloud and therefore have been the
more prepared to keep within the home borders.</p>
<p>She was, however, as welcome as sunshine in both adjoining
territories&mdash;the Westerleys&rsquo; and the
Sturgis&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Colonel Westerley, who was getting very
blind, found her invaluable as a guide.&nbsp; Again and again I
have listened to them on their tours round the beds, Rose&rsquo;s
clear little voice raised <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>(for he was getting deaf too) to
keep him in touch with the progress of every plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the fritillaries are&rdquo;&mdash;she had
great difficulty with some of the names.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are
two new purple speckled ones and three white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re opposite the auriculas.&nbsp; The
yellow ones are terrific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, how the rain has broken down the
tulips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re opposite the hedge-sparrow&rsquo;s
nest.&nbsp; Wait a minute while I see if there are any more
eggs.&nbsp; No, only three still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she would mark the changes of each morning, meanwhile
leading the gentle old warrior by the hand.</p>
<p>The three Sturgis sisters&mdash;though none of them was
destined to soar to the realms of bliss as Mrs. Julius
Greville&mdash;fulfilled part of the destiny that the other Rose,
all unconsciously, had planned for them, by becoming the most
solicitous foster-mothers to her daughter.&nbsp; Out of their
unselfishness and their leisure they suggested that Rose should
go to them for lessons: a proposal that I was very glad to
accept; and so it came about that the eldest gave Rose an hour a
day with pencil and paint brushes in the studio (Rose&rsquo;s
grandfather&rsquo;s studio), and the other two each an hour in
more general instruction.&nbsp; Having a full measure of the
Quaker placidity to keep them contented with their lot, they had
no wish to roam, and were thus ever to be depended upon.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Not
that their lot was to be despised, for they had turned
Theodore&rsquo;s house into a very beautiful serene place.&nbsp;
It was a Georgian house, panelled in white, with many recesses;
and the three sisters had filled these with blue china.&nbsp; The
gods dispense their gifts capriciously, and upon these
descendants of a sect vowed to hostility to the arts and graces
they had conferred the most exquisite taste.&nbsp; A series of
provident ancestors had put them into a position to gratify most
of their wishes, and their home kept pace with modern culture in
all its quieter aspects.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Rose, you see, if she had not many friends, had very good
ones.&nbsp; Her chief lack was the chief lack of many only
children&mdash;contemporaries.&nbsp; How much happier she would
have been had she playmates of her own age, I cannot say; but it
is absurd to pretend that without them she was unhappy.</p>
<p>And this I can say with certainty: she kept me young.&nbsp;
She did not actually transform me into a contemporary, but she so
arranged it that there was very little awkwardness or fear
between us.&nbsp; I am not pretending to have been in her
complete confidence, I am merely stating the fact that we were
under very little constraint together.</p>
<p>Even had we been real contemporaries, how could we really have
known each other!&nbsp; A man may guess at a man&rsquo;s
thoughts, may fairly safely measure him by himself; but how can a
man <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>guess at a girl&rsquo;s thoughts?&nbsp; Speech reveals
so few of them.&nbsp; If while one is speaking twenty words one
can be thinking of a hundred different things, what of the silent
pauses?&nbsp; How they must teem!&nbsp; Where was my Rose when
her blue eyes looked through their black lashes into space?&nbsp;
How could I follow her unaided?&nbsp; Or would she have aided
me?&nbsp; Not would, but could.&nbsp; Could she have told
me?&nbsp; Could any of us tell all our thoughts in any given
hour?&nbsp; Even if ships that passed in the night signalled to
each other the whole passenger list there would always be a few
of the steerage and some of the crew unnamed.&nbsp; And if those
were revealed, there would still be a stowaway!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One matter never mentioned between Rose and me was her
mother&rsquo;s <i>faux pas</i>.&nbsp; What the child knew about
this I did not discover, or wish to.&nbsp; I am old-fashioned
enough to prefer to talk of grown-up matters only with grown-up
people.&nbsp; The longer the gaiety and happiness of children can
be unclouded by knowledge of the difficulties and disasters which
can proceed from our emotional instincts, the better.&nbsp; So
far as I was concerned Rose was ignorant of her mother&rsquo;s
rebellion.&nbsp; We talked about her as a child, but we did not
touch on recent history.&nbsp; English families are marvellous in
their capacity to regulate conversational reservations.</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>One
funny little pet turn of speech to which Rose was addicted comes
back to me very vividly as I write.&nbsp; Every one has favourite
locutions, and Rose had the habit of prefacing many of her
remarks with the phrase &ldquo;As a matter of fact&rdquo;; only,
being mostly in a hurry to express herself, she used to contract
the last three words to one: &ldquo;As a maffact.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Very few minutes could pass, when we were together and she was
unburdening herself on this or that question, without her
beginning a sentence: &ldquo;As a maffact, Dombeen.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When the War came Rose was thirteen and I was sixty-five; and
we were therefore both non-combatants.&nbsp; But it did not leave
us&mdash;any more than anyone else&mdash;untouched; for I was old
enough to be saddened and shocked by the calamities that it bred;
and Rose was young enough to be ripe for the new Hedonism which
the peace inaugurated and which is still in full swing.&nbsp;
Ronnie, the other Rose told me, longed to be in it, but was too
delicate, and they remained on their estate throughout its
lengthy course.</p>
<p>The War found the old Colonel still living, but he did not
long survive.&nbsp; He was not of the kind that spends its breath
in lamenting the decadence of the Army in present times&mdash;I
never heard him couple the Service and the dogs&mdash;but he had
had his little autobiographical weaknesses, in which border
skirmishes played no inconspicuous part, <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>and in the
presence of the gigantic drama in Belgium and France he found his
occupation gone.&nbsp; No one wanted to listen to him any more;
and he was too aged and infirm to be of any use.&nbsp; The War
must have hit countless other retired officers in this way and in
a moment have dried up their streams of reminiscence and emptied
all their boasts.&nbsp; The Colonel was, however, a rural
gentleman and not a frequenter of clubs, and his lot was
comparatively easy; but I saw a steady decline in his strength,
and he did not long survive the death of two of his grandsons in
the Battle of Mons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Colonel was not our only loss.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman
had been declining for some time, and in the early spring she
also left us.</p>
<p>I have been at many death-beds, and at most the grief was that
of the living rather than the dying.&nbsp; Nature has mercifully
arranged that most people are ready for the end&mdash;even look
forward to it.&nbsp; Suffering or weakness has broken down their
resistance: the goal they desire is peace.&nbsp; Others, with
more fight in them, morphia lulls into acquiescence.&nbsp; But
Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman needed no drugs, nor were there tears to
distress her.&nbsp; Being the last of her clan her house was
uninvested by relations.&nbsp; Only the faithful Julia, her
servants and I were about.&nbsp; Steadily and quietly her flame
lowered and was extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to die,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it
wouldn&rsquo;t <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>be true to say I should want to if I had
strength.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a muddling old world, but one hates
the dark.&nbsp; And I like to know what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; I
should have liked to see your new Rose growing up.&nbsp; And that
other Rose, poor darling, I don&rsquo;t like leaving her.&nbsp;
And my little Peek, it will be horrid not to be able to pat him
and give him his sugar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps when we&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;we can still watch our friends.&nbsp; If so, you can be
very sure I shall be watching you.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
worry.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t move the furniture or bother you with
manifestations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll simply be looking on, and if
there&rsquo;s any means by which a spirit can add to the content
of a living friend, you can be sure I shall apply it.&nbsp; But
there can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;or we should all
be happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin,&rdquo; she said another time,
&ldquo;that all we can leave are our twopenny-halfpenny
possessions.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t we leave our brains?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t pretend that mine are particularly desirable, but
they would be a godsend to that stupid woolly Mrs. Stansted, for
example.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity I can&rsquo;t hand them on to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the end she kept up her spirit and to the end she teased
poor Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ordered your mourning yet?&rdquo; she asked
her once.</p>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s reply was a sound of protest and a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want you to.&nbsp; I told you to.&nbsp; All this
fuss about a simple little matter like dying is so <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>ridiculous.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you want me to be happy
in heaven, Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen.&nbsp; I command you to get your
mourning.&nbsp; I want to see if it becomes you.&nbsp; Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; A young bride is allowed to see the
bridesmaids who are to follow her to the church; why should an
old widow woman be prevented from seeing what her chief mourner
will look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing, however, could get Julia to consider death a subject
matter for discussion, or as anything but a gaunt, grisly,
abnormal happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they don&rsquo;t insist on one&rsquo;s entering
heaven the very instant one dies,&rdquo; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman said
at another time.&nbsp; &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t suit me at
all.&nbsp; What I want is a really long sleep first&mdash;weeks
and weeks of it.&nbsp; What do you think, Julia, will they be in
such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Julia, all this was hard to bear; but when the old
lady&rsquo;s soul and body did at last part company and her will
was made public, it was found that the legacy to her faithful
companion was ten times larger than she had foreshadowed in
conversations.&nbsp; The poor of the village were remembered
also, and both the Roses had little mementoes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We lost the Fergussons too, although not by death.&nbsp; They
had not long remained at the Hall after the burial of the
hatchet, even though my <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>invaluable attendance was theirs
once more.&nbsp; They had become restless and discontented.&nbsp;
The Hall estate had been bought for Ronnie to succeed to; and of
what use was it now?&nbsp; Sir Edmund had nothing to do&mdash;his
interest in tree-planting and general improvements disappeared,
and he gradually took a dislike to the place.&nbsp; The result
was that they left for one of the Continental health
resorts&mdash;Aix-les-Bains, I think it was.&nbsp; When they went
I decided to take no new patients, and gradually allowed my
practice to pass to others, and when Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman died I
retired altogether.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I said something a little while back about Rose and her
ignorance of her mother&rsquo;s flight&mdash;or, at any rate,
silence regarding it.&nbsp; That was when she was a child.&nbsp;
But later, when she had reached the teens, references to her
mother gradually came naturally into her conversation, and she
would even ask me about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about mother, Dombeen,&rdquo; she would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was she like me?&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman says
that our voices are just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you like her better than me?&rdquo;&nbsp; She
wanted to know this very badly.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that she had collected other views as well as
mine and had a fairly sound idea of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was naughty to run away from
father,&rdquo; she began once, after one of Eustace&rsquo;s <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>visits,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here she broke off with a
suspicion of a chuckle.</p>
<p>I was careful not to ask her to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Sometimes she propounded terrible posers, which were not made
any simpler by being dropped from clear skies in the midst of
talk on the most innocent of themes.&nbsp; I remember one evening
I was pointing out the constellations.</p>
<p>I had just said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Orion&rsquo;s
Belt,&rdquo; when she inquired, &ldquo;Do you think, Dombeen,
that husbands and wives, when they love other people, ought to go
on living together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that has nothing to do with astronomy,&rdquo; was
my feeble reply.</p>
<p>Another time, after another of Eustace&rsquo;s visits:
&ldquo;What do men look like when their hearts are
broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I found I had married the wrong man I should leave
him,&rdquo; was another announcement.&nbsp; (This was when she
was sixteen.)&nbsp; &ldquo;As a maffact, Dombeen, I expect I
shall make a mistake like that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how one
can help it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always got tired of everything up
to now, so why should it be different with a husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the War virus working with a vengeance!&nbsp; We all
had to adjust ourselves to that, we old people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it is with my contemporaries, but the
truth about me is that at thirty I was much surer of myself and
of accepted dogma than I am at seventy.&nbsp; At thirty, if I had
heard a young <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>girl remark that chastity is absurdly overrated, I
should have been shocked; to-day I find myself capable of
wondering if it may not be true: if we do not, in protecting that
shadow, allow much sound substance to deteriorate?&nbsp; Doctors
see more than most spectators, and with these eyes I have watched
many and many an open-natured girl shrivel into an old maid and
her finer juices turn to gall&mdash;all because she was not wooed
and had not the courage to defy convention and woo for
herself.&nbsp; The older one grows, the smaller is the number of
sins.&nbsp; I can enumerate very few now, and if I live much
longer there will be only one, and that is meanness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t our bodies our own, to do as we like
with?&rdquo; is a question that may be said to be in the air in
these days.&nbsp; And how explain to any young person, girl or
boy, that the answer is No?</p>
<p>Rose was not, so far as I could tell, as modern as this.&nbsp;
But of course I could not hope for complete knowledge of her,
even if I had probed for it.&nbsp; December and April are not
confidants: at most they can be sympathetic.&nbsp; Such insight
as I had into her philosophy and creed of living had to be
gathered from generalities: from her comments on the day&rsquo;s
news, from her selective readings aloud from the papers, from her
attitude to local misdemeanour: whether lenient or
censorious.&nbsp; Lenience was certainly her tendency.&nbsp; In
the idiom of to-day she was &ldquo;for&rdquo; all
insurrectionists; she could even find it in her heart to <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>be sorry
for miners.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder they strike, poor
things.&nbsp; The mystery is how they can go on digging that
horrid black stuff at all, in the pitch dark too, no matter how
much you pay them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was one afternoon when Rose was eighteen that I realized
that she was no longer merely a girl.&nbsp; Suddenly the peace of
the garden was invaded by a series of snorts and explosions, and
a motor-car rushed up the drive&mdash;one of those absurd little
cars, very small and low, like an important roller skate, with
just room for two, and a naked nymph in silver and without shame
poised over the bonnet by way of mascot.&nbsp; The kind of
vehicle brought into existence to meet the demands of
second-lieutenants.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards I was told that
a gentleman wished to see me, and behold there he was, in the
sitting-room&mdash;a tall young man with a tiny moustache exactly
the same width as his nose, and purple socks.&nbsp; Although
obviously not lacking in self-assurance, he advanced rather
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know I have retired from practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, it isn&rsquo;t about any old malady,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank Heaven I&rsquo;m as fit as a
fiddle.&nbsp; The fact is, I wanted to ask your advice.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s about&mdash;Miss, Miss Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; I knew instinctively what was
coming, but it was no business of mine to <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>make it any
easier for the young bandits who proposed to carry off this
treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the fact is, you know,
she&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s no one so topping; or perhaps you
don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be ignorant?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m so old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re her guardian, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And
living here as she does. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I see,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean that
only strangers can discover how delightful people can
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly that,&rdquo; he stammered,
&ldquo;although, as a matter of fact, you know, one does rather
take one&rsquo;s own people for granted.&nbsp; My sister Belle
now&mdash;to me she&rsquo;s the stodgiest kind of old thing, but
you should see the fellows after her.&nbsp; Like flies.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re not as keen as I am about Miss Holt,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
Rose&mdash;Miss Holt&mdash;is much nicer away from home than she
is when she is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s always
charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if neither of these is the reason, I am
bound,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to fall back on the theory that I am
too old to recognize sweetness when I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in a hole now and showed it.&nbsp; I liked him for his
confusion.&nbsp; I liked to think that any young man,
particularly one who had been through a war so much more
destructive of good manners <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>and good morals and honest standards
of living than of militarism, should still be capable of
embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if I
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every one
smokes now.&nbsp; Tobacco is the next thing to mother&rsquo;s
milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a cigarette from a gold case and tapped it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s only a gasper,&rdquo; he
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it was a pipe,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipes don&rsquo;t appeal to me any more,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took to cigarettes in France and
I&rsquo;ve never gone back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few whiffs seemed to give him courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came
to see you,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;because I want to
marry Miss Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent for a minute, during which I was taking him all
in, and reviewing Rose&rsquo;s life, and seeing them together,
and speculating on the future, and realizing how different this
happy-go-lucky youth, with a touch of effrontery and few thoughts
for anything but motoring and dancing, was from the husband I had
been wishing for her.&nbsp; It is extraordinary what a lot can be
thought about in sixty seconds.&nbsp; Meanwhile he puffed his
gasper and nursed his little moustache and swung a leg with so
much purple sock now exposed that a suspender was visible
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live about here?&rdquo; I asked at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to remember your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying with my uncle, Major
Wilkinson,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s
Sibthorp.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;And what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not doing anything at the moment.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve only just been demobbed.&nbsp; I may possibly go back
to Oxford.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d rather make some money.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s talk of the mater setting me up as a
chicken-farmer.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a devil of a lot of eggs
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do in the war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the Air Force.&nbsp; Jolly lucky too.&nbsp; I
never had a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you scratched a Hun or two, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I did,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any medals?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the D.S.O.,&rdquo; he replied simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let me shake your hand,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but remember that it is entirely without prejudice to the
other matter.&nbsp; Do you happen to know how Miss Holt feels
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I think she thinks I&rsquo;m a pretty decent
sort,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you like her?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
doesn&rsquo;t rouge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loathe rouge,&rdquo; he said warmly.</p>
<p>I shook him by the hand again&mdash;again warning him that it
was without prejudice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she like you at all?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She likes jazzing with me, I know,&rdquo; he assured
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life isn&rsquo;t a dance,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
that.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s a jolly serious affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are proposing that Miss Holt should help you
with the poultry?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d love it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This means,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you would have
to live in the country, and give constant attention to the
work.&nbsp; No more jazzing, and very little motoring except to
the market?&nbsp; Do you think that&rsquo;s an existence for a
girl of brains and ambition and high spirits, who happens to be
an artist too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face took on an expression of perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;she&rsquo;d be married,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think that love in an isolated cottage
surrounded by roosters and incubators, with only one human
companion, is a sufficient paradise to offer her?&nbsp; Upon my
word, you seem to me to be uncommonly sure of your
fascination.&nbsp; She would have to be very fond of you to give
up her present home and pursuits, even with the society of a very
aged man occasionally thrust upon her, and take to
chicken-farming.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it occur to you that that
would be a big sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but one must begin,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The poultry business would only be a start.&nbsp; We might
go on to much bigger things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be time to talk about marriage,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;when you have made some of that progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you refuse to consider me?&rdquo; he asked
ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not for
me to decide anything.&nbsp; Rose has a father.&nbsp; But I
should certainly put what obstacles I could in your way, until
you had something better to propose as a means of livelihood than
a chicken-farm in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t forbid me to see her, or
anything like that?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; And I couldn&rsquo;t if I wanted
to.&nbsp; See as much of her as she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she told you that I&mdash;if she ever said
anything about marrying me&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t put a spoke
in the wheel, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should do nothing to discourage her,&rdquo; I
said&mdash;&ldquo;not from any desire to see her marry you, but
for the opposite reason.&nbsp; Old though I am, I have not
forgotten that forbidden fruit is the most attractive.&nbsp; So I
shouldn&rsquo;t forbid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, that&rsquo;s brainy,&rdquo; he said, with
genuine admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never have thought of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you have put your
case to Miss Holt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in so many words,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought I would see you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather an unusual course nowadays,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s how the mater felt, anyway.&nbsp; It
was her idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talked it over with your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Rose is all ignorant of this visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I shook hands with him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very remarkable young man,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You respect your mother&rsquo;s wishes and you
don&rsquo;t like rouged girls.&nbsp; I most cordially hope you
will succeed in the egg market.&nbsp; But as for <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Rose, I can
tell you something.&nbsp; Rose is in love with nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know her fairly well,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;and to have kept her under a certain amount of
observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, once more, that I am too old?&nbsp; Maybe;
but I guess that on this particular subject I am right.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell her that you called.&nbsp; Good
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you?&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to say nothing about it and let me
see her first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but that
isn&rsquo;t the way that Miss Holt and I do things.&nbsp; We put
the cards on the table.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked moodily to his little runabout, cranked it, lighted
another cigarette (although what use a cigarette can be in a
thirty-mile gale such as he was about to create for himself, I
have no notion) and was off.</p>
<p>He left me thinking that the chances are that if I live on
another twenty years, to be ninety&mdash;which I trust may not
happen, even with the assistance of the new monkey-gland
treatment&mdash;and I still retain a few faculties of hearing and
speech and the simulacrum of a sympathetic heart, some young
spark of the future will endeavour to engage my interest to help
him in his courtship of Rose&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;some young
spark not <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>yet born, desiring a bride not yet born.&nbsp; That
would seem to be my destiny.&nbsp; But perhaps by 1940 there will
be no such tedious preliminaries: nothing but capture and
possession&mdash;and awakening.&nbsp; Or will the rhythm of life
have reasserted itself and old-fashioned prejudices have
returned?&nbsp; We move in circles.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>During dinner that evening I said to Rose: &ldquo;There was a
young fellow here this afternoon asking after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archie Sebright, I suppose,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some one who dances
with you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reggie Saunderson, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a very small moustache,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and he came in an even smaller car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack Nimmo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had purple socks,
with clocks, and showed too much of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must have been Claude Musters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me,&rdquo; she insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
are you such a tease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name was Sibthorp,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Rose replied, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s staying with
the Wilkinsons.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s rather a nuisance, but he did
well in the War, every one says.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s terrible, the
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>bores
that did well in the War!&nbsp; What did he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only to marry
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like his cheek,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None the less,&rdquo; I said, during our
dessert&mdash;and I have some rather good Taylor 1880 which
deserves to be sipped slowly&mdash;&ldquo;this question of
marriage is bound to crop up now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a not repellent young woman, and
the neighbourhood appears to be infested by Claudes and Reggies,
and Nature is always urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to marry any of them,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;or in fact anyone at all.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t we
go on as we are?&nbsp; Why is life always changing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but the
law of life is change.&nbsp; We either go forward&mdash;or
backward.&nbsp; Every quiet little time such as this that I spend
with you, alone, talking and not (which is the true curse of
Adam) getting ready to do anything else, I am full of
fearfulness, just because I know that there is no standing
still.&nbsp; They are all stolen.&nbsp; To you they may be dull;
to me these moments are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose put her hand on mine.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
dull,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
spoiling it!&nbsp; It is exactly as I said.&nbsp; What do you
look at the time for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I promised Claude
I&rsquo;d show him a new step to-night; but he&rsquo;s not coming
till half-past nine.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got nearly a whole
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>I
sighed.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the use?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on talking about marriage,&rdquo; she
said, drawing her chair closer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I
marry?&nbsp; Every girl doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp;
Some one in the paper said only the other day that there are many
more women than men and therefore lots of them must be
single.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to, there&rsquo;s no earthly reason why you
shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t
arrange these things.&nbsp; At any moment you may fall in love,
and what then?&nbsp; Marriage has a way of following
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-e-s,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;But one
needn&rsquo;t fall in love.&nbsp; Lots of people
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You never did&mdash;at any rate, if you did,
marriage didn&rsquo;t follow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Nature
marked me for a bachelor, and destiny made me a vicarious
father.&nbsp; I have been more or less of a vicarious father,
Rose, ever since I was twenty-seven, and now I&rsquo;m
sixty-eight: forty-one years of it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had no time
to fall in love, your mother and you have kept me so busy.&nbsp;
But tell me about this young warrior.&nbsp; Why should he want to
marry you?&nbsp; Have you given him any encouragement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except to listen to
him and show him steps.&nbsp; They all want to talk and be shown
steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a country fit for heroes to dance in,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what about the poultry farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O he told you that, did he?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me that.&nbsp; The demand for eggs is
something priceless, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget him,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she resumed a moment later, &ldquo;why must
there always be marriage?&nbsp; Marriages so often go
wrong.&nbsp; Look at Dulcie Lenox&mdash;she&rsquo;s left her
husband already.&nbsp; Look at the divorce cases!&nbsp; Why
can&rsquo;t two people love and get the best of life and then go
their own way again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the sake of society,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;the human family.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all got to help to
keep that together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we?&rdquo; Rose asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t ask to be born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but being born, we must play the game.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s part of the contract.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s our payment for
the privilege of existing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just chivalry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like to put it like that.&nbsp; But most of us
are rather proud of the obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we say no; that we don&rsquo;t care a pin about
the human family; all we care about is our own happiness, what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then we&rsquo;re traitors, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been found wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a shame, isn&rsquo;t it, to force so
much responsibility on people who never asked for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is.&nbsp; But life without
responsibility wouldn&rsquo;t be worth anything.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a conclusion I&rsquo;ve reached after sixty-eight
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t count up!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re much too
proud of those figures.&nbsp; But when did you discover it?&nbsp;
When you were eighteen, like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;No, when I was eighteen I thought more or less
as you do; only not quite so freely, because there had been no
great war to break down our ideals and set up materialism and
belief in the divine right of every individual to be selfish and
anti-social.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s what we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many people are.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m quite
conscious that they may be right and the others wrong.&nbsp; In
fact, the older I grow, the more convinced I am that everyone,
however wrong, has some right in him, and every one, however
right, some wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not going to marry for years and
years,&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to paint
first.&nbsp; Art will be my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a little dancing with human partners thrown
in?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the bell rang, indicating that the pupil had
arrived, and for the next hour my would-be Rosa Bonheur was
showing steps.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>How few things we should do if we had time to examine
carefully every action and its possible consequences before we
committed ourselves to it!&nbsp; I for one, probably&mdash;but
one never knows&mdash;instead of encouraging Rose in her drawing
and painting should have discouraged her; for it led straight to
London, and when your children, your own or your foster-children,
get to London, <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>they are lost.&nbsp; New lives begin, with new
parents&mdash;for London is father and mother too.&nbsp; Careers
have to be, I suppose, and leading strings must be cut&mdash;but
O! the severance of heart-strings that that operation involves as
well!</p>
<p>Anyway, I had taken an immense interest in Rose&rsquo;s
sketches, and often sat with her while she made them, and
marvelled&mdash;being a hopeless duffer at such work&mdash;as the
swift deft touches transferred the landscape to the paper: sky
and earth and water.&nbsp; She may not have been remarkable, but
to my eyes she was as clever as anyone sketching nature need
be.&nbsp; Her portraits were good too: at any rate, lifelike
enough to provoke cries of delight from the villagers as they
recognized their neighbours.&nbsp; She was a straightforward
performer: she cubed nothing and abhorred a vortex; but artists
are curiously impressionable people, visitors to this planet
rather than dwellers upon it, and at any moment she might become
as wild as the wildest.&nbsp; And I am not surprised: the power
to splash colour about must naturally lead to
experimentalism.</p>
<p>In those days, however, Rose was in the old and sober
tradition, and the desire to paint filled her soul.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At last the go-fever broke out.&nbsp; She had been to
London&mdash;that promoter of restlessness&mdash;to stay with a
girl artist friend and show her work <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>to some experts and see the
exhibitions, and she came back glowing with excitement and
plans.&nbsp; She returned with her hair intact too, to my great
joy.&nbsp; I had nursed a terror that she might bob it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money have I got?&rdquo; was one of the first
things she said to me after dinner.</p>
<p>During the meal I had heard the story of her adventures.&nbsp;
How she had stayed with her friend Vera Gray in her studio at
Chelsea.&nbsp; It was on the Embankment, looking out on the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And O!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the river is
exactly what Whistler made it.&nbsp; I mean&mdash;exactly how he
painted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I interrupted her to say that no studied compliment could ever
have pleased that painter so much as her hurried slip; but she
didn&rsquo;t want to hear me; she wanted to talk and tell.</p>
<p>They had slept in the studio, in a little gallery up a ladder,
where there was also a bathroom.&nbsp; They had cooked their own
breakfast, but had gone out for other meals.&nbsp; I had no idea
what Vera&rsquo;s coffee was like!&nbsp; And her cups and saucers
and plates: all blue and white, from Portugal: it
cost&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d never guess how cheap it was.</p>
<p>I asked her if she had called on her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t you to have done so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;but&mdash;well, as a maffact, he would probably have
disapproved of Chelsea and made me stay with him.&nbsp; For
another reason, I didn&rsquo;t really think he <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>wanted to
see me.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve very little in common, you know,
Dombeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wise child who knows when she
doesn&rsquo;t want her father to know she&rsquo;s in town,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
I added: &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t much in common.&nbsp; But you
oughtn&rsquo;t to presume on that, ought you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, and upon my word, I
couldn&rsquo;t reply.&nbsp; Why should children be dutiful any
more than their parents?</p>
<p>If Eustace took no interest in Rose, why should Rose take
interest in him?&nbsp; Logically, it is the older who should set
the example: the more mature, the person who is responsible for
the child&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; I doubt very much if there is
any natural affinity between parents and children: pride of
ownership on the one side and dependence on the other leads to
the creation of a bond.&nbsp; Remove babies at birth and do not
let them meet their mothers again until they are grown up, and
(in spite of the romantic and sentimental novelists) I doubt if
there would be any natural recognition, any calling of the
deeps.</p>
<p>Vera, Rose went on, had done a little work&mdash;not
much&mdash;and then they had gone out to visit other studios,
where Vera&rsquo;s friends lived.&nbsp; I could have no idea how
jolly they all were.&nbsp; People talked about the jealousy of
artists, but for her part she didn&rsquo;t believe a word of
it.&nbsp; There they were, all so keen and simple, wearing the
most delightful old clothes, pleased to see each other, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>pleased to
praise each other&rsquo;s work&mdash;genuinely,
too&mdash;absolutely genuinely&mdash;and then directly it was too
dark to go on, or they didn&rsquo;t feel in the mood, off they
went to dinner at one of the Soho places, and then they either
talked about painting, ever so interestingly, or danced or
sang.&nbsp; It was the most wonderful life.</p>
<p>But I mustn&rsquo;t think for a moment that they were
slackers.&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; As a maffact, they worked
frightfully hard.&nbsp; But artists, I must remember, don&rsquo;t
divide up their lives into work and play as other people
do&mdash;clerks and merchants and lawyers and so on: they mix the
two together.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes them so
delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all have such charming things,&rdquo; she said,
looking round at my furniture&mdash;Victorian mostly, not old
enough to be beautiful&mdash;with a kind of disdain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No matter how poor they are, they always seem to have
money for &lsquo;bits.&rsquo;&nbsp; They&rsquo;re always on the
look-out for them, and they have such wonderful eyes.&nbsp; They
can see things under inches of dust.&nbsp; Going about among the
old furniture and old curiosity shops with Vera and her friends
was an education, and such a lark too!&nbsp; You and I must go
over to Lowcester, Dombeen, and rout about in the old shops
there.&nbsp; I know so much more about things than I did a month
ago.&nbsp; I know the difference between Heppelwhite and
Chippendale and Spode and Crown Derby.&nbsp; And I mean to learn
it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been to the National Gallery three times, <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>and to the
Tate, and to several little exhibitions, and to the Caf&eacute;
Royal one evening, and to two plays.&nbsp; But the most terrific
thing of all was this&mdash;she had seen John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John who?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not John anything,&rdquo; she replied, shocked at my
ignorance.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his last name, but no one ever
calls him anything else&mdash;John the artist: much the strongest
painter we&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; Vera asked him to come and see my
things, and he came and he likes them.&nbsp; He says I ought to
make a real name if I study properly and go to a life class and
devote myself to drawing for a while.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my drawing
that&rsquo;s weak, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Rose suddenly asked, after a brief silence,
&ldquo;How much money have I got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her that she had no money at all, unless her father
chose to give her any.&nbsp; He reimbursed me more or less for
what she cost me, and her school accounts and so forth had gone
to him.&nbsp; It was all very irregular; of course she ought to
have an allowance by this time.&nbsp; She was eighteen.</p>
<p>Her face lost its radiance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Must I ask
him?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on what you want it for,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to live in Chelsea,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
really learn to paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it had been for
anything else I might have been able to contribute, but I
can&rsquo;t for that.&nbsp; That is too drastic.&nbsp; You must
ask your father.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I could
hardly <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>bring myself to finance a scheme which leaves me so
high and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Dombeen!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;d soon get used to being alone.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;d
come down often for the week-end.&nbsp; As a maffact, you&rsquo;d
hardly miss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Train up a child and away she goes,&rdquo; I
quoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t have me not be
independent?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything is all
right: just as it should be.&nbsp; An old man must expect to lose
a young girl just when she is most companionable.&nbsp; But you
must concede him a little melancholy.&nbsp; After all, it is a
compliment to you, so concede it purely in that light.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s as proper for me to regret your going as for you to
want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old thing!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hate to leave you, but what should one do?&nbsp; If you
absolutely needed me, of course . . . but you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re strong, you go about, you have your prints and your
gardening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even if I hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
should not allow you to stay.&nbsp; If I am to collapse, it shall
not be an artist on the threshold of life with a passion to
express herself in oils who shall bring my beef-tea.&nbsp; That
would be too unfair.&nbsp; But you must understand that nothing
can be done until your father consents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to him to-night,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless you will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
a long way <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>to help you, but I won&rsquo;t sign my own death
warrant.&nbsp; No seaman beseeches to be marooned.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Eustace replied that he thought he might be willing, but it
would be well to discuss the matter properly.&nbsp; Would she
stay with him for a few days and bring some of her work with
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I show it to him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all, he is
your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so&mdash;so&mdash;personal,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I asked, when she came back a few days
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bored him terribly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never knew what to say.&nbsp; Besides, his habits
are fixed.&nbsp; I ruined his breakfast because he couldn&rsquo;t
read the paper.&nbsp; I would much rather he had read it, but he
was trying to behave so beautifully and he made conversation
instead.&nbsp; This means that he never caught up with the news
all day, and that&rsquo;s a very serious thing.&nbsp; I made the
awful mistake too of opening the paper before he did, before he
came in&mdash;this was on the first morning&mdash;and no woman,
it seems, must do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, I&rsquo;m not right at all.&nbsp; As a maffact,
Dombeen, you&rsquo;ve spoilt me.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m too <a

205</span>impulsive.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t be impulsive with
men, except perhaps just one or two, and those only for a little
while and when they&rsquo;re very pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did other terrible things too.&nbsp; I used the
telephone frivolously.&nbsp; I even rang up the exchange once
just to ask the time, and he heard me.&nbsp; I had done it often
enough when he was out, because my watch had stopped and his
clock was away being mended; but he came in just as I was ringing
and I never saw anyone so pained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And O! I left the electric light burning in the hall
all one night.&nbsp; He was perfectly nice and kind and polite,
but I could see that every day something new was being inscribed
on his heart, like Queen Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean
our Queen Mary.&nbsp; I mean the Queen Mary who lost
Calais&mdash;the bloody one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like my painting at all,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;but he was very gentle about it.&nbsp; He was
always gentle&mdash;gentle and cool&mdash;and that is so
depressing after a while.&nbsp; Disturbing, too.&nbsp; He took me
to the Tate Gallery on Saturday afternoon, and to the National on
Sunday, and showed me the pictures he likes best.&nbsp; He has
two photogravures after Leader in his bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you decided anything?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; It
was all I wanted to know and she was postponing and postponing
the moment of the verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, but without much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t hear of independent rooms in
Chelsea.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like Chelsea.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
too <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>irresponsible, he says.&nbsp; But he agrees to a
Hostel&mdash;he&rsquo;s inquiring about them now&mdash;and the
Slade, I may go to the Slade and live in a Hostel, for three
years.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t what I wanted, of course, but
it&rsquo;s the thin end of the wedge.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be able to
go to Chelsea to see Vera and the others pretty nearly whenever I
like, and the Slade isn&rsquo;t so bad.&nbsp; Orpen was there and
John was there.&nbsp; What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want to begin?&rdquo; I asked dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the next term,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was our last evening.&nbsp; To-morrow the little mawf was
to fly away towards those great flames, London, Art, and
Independence, all capable of scorching very acutely.&nbsp; To
Rose the hours were all a prelude to adventure; to me a promise
of loneliness.&nbsp; For so long this graceful, gay enthusiast
had been lighting up my house; and now I was to be
forsaken.&nbsp; At seventy that is no particular joke.</p>
<p>To what extent Rose had pondered on what might lightly be
called the selfishness of her programme, I cannot say.&nbsp;
Perhaps not at all, but I think that very unlikely.&nbsp; My own
attitude to her desertion, although I did my best to make it
whimsical, must have turned her thoughts that way.&nbsp; But
having pondered, might she not very properly have decided that
such selfishness was <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>her only course?&nbsp; Our duty is
not always to others.&nbsp; Comparatively lost as I was going to
be, I certainly did not want her to make the sacrifice of
remaining.&nbsp; Why should she?&nbsp; What right has seventy to
cramp the style of twenty?&nbsp; Too many young people are
harnessed&mdash;more than harnessed, shackled&mdash;to the old,
for me to be willing to add to their number.&nbsp; I have watched
youthful lives being sapped and thwarted in this way ever since I
have been in practice, and I had always vowed that never would I
be guilty of a similar tyranny.&nbsp; And now here I was with the
temptation!</p>
<p>But it was not the temptation that it might have been had Rose
come to me and said, &ldquo;Look here, Dombeen, I can&rsquo;t
leave you all alone.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
give up this London scheme and we&rsquo;ll go on being happy
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even then, however, I hope I should have
been strong enough to say No.&nbsp; In fact, I know I should; for
what is the use of binding a girl of eighteen, or letting her
bind herself?&nbsp; Art she might relinquish; but what would
happen when Love appeared?&nbsp; How could I keep her to her
promise then?&nbsp; Better face the music, take the fence, cut
the knot now, and be brave about it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We sat long after dinner on that last evening.&nbsp;
Rose&rsquo;s boxes were packed, her room at the Hostel and her
easel at the Slade awaited her.&nbsp; She had <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>said all
her good-byes in the neighbourhood, and no doubt more than one of
her dancing friends had her address in his pocket-book.&nbsp; In
short, practically every boat was burnt.&nbsp; All our talk,
therefore, was of the future.&nbsp; If Eustace was not too
unwilling, she said, she should go to Paris after a while.&nbsp;
As a maffact, Paris was, of course, the place.&nbsp; London was
only a makeshift.&nbsp; She would probably go on to Paris
anyway&mdash;father or no father.&nbsp; Because one must be
thorough.&nbsp; London was looking up&mdash;everybody said
so&mdash;Chelsea had produced some wonderful things&mdash;but for
an artist Paris was the true Alma Mater.&nbsp; Even Chelsea had
had to go to Paris first.</p>
<p>It was all a question of money.&nbsp; Surely when she was
twenty-one her father would allow her something reasonable?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the purpose of doing anything of which he might
disapprove,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>O well, she would see.&nbsp; She would begin at the Slade,
anyway, and make up her mind gradually.&nbsp; &ldquo;But of
course,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;Paris is the place.&nbsp;
Sooner or later I must be there.&nbsp; I can hear it calling all
the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said those words, Rose left the window where she had
been standing and walked into the garden, whither no doubt she
expected me to follow her.</p>
<p>I was about to do so when there was a knock at the door and
Suzanne entered, with a curious excited flush on her face.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>She
stood there a moment, as though trying to speak, and then,
stepping aside, made room for some one in a black dress and veil,
and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dombeen!&rdquo; cried the stranger, and buried her
thin, tired face on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Of what I said I have no memory.&nbsp; I can remember only
stroking her head and hushing her like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; I may have
murmured; but it was foolish, for tears were her best
friends.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rose?&rdquo; she asked at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could see her without her seeing
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I said, and went to the garden to
look for Rose, but she had disappeared.</p>
<p>I returned to her mother and began to be practical.&nbsp; She
had come in a car, and the first thing to do was to take her bag
out and send it back.&nbsp; Then she consented to eat something,
and while it was being prepared I had the story.</p>
<p>Ronnie and she had been on their way back to England.&nbsp; He
had wanted to see his mother again, and his father&rsquo;s
executors too.&nbsp; But at Marseilles Ronnie had died.&nbsp; It
was where her father had died thirty-six years before&mdash;how
strange a coincidence!</p>
<p>Ronnie&rsquo;s death followed up a chill, which he had taken,
she feared, on a visit to Theodore&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; They had
gone to see it directly after <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>landing, and Ronnie now lay in the
same cemetery, close by.&nbsp; Was not that remarkable?</p>
<p>Since then she had been travelling steadily towards her
daughter and me.&nbsp; No one knew of her presence in England but
Ronnie&rsquo;s mother, living now permanently at Torquay, who had
been written to.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Rose the other Rose&mdash;came
back.&nbsp; I saw her across the lawn&mdash;her dress shone among
the shadows&mdash;but her mother&rsquo;s back being to the
window, she could not see her too.</p>
<p>Making some excuse, I slipped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Rose asked, with a startled look, and
a voice almost of fear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&nbsp; Is&mdash;is he
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She gave a little wailing cry and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose!&nbsp; Rose!&rdquo; I called, but she did not
reply.</p>
<p>I went back to her mother and urged her to go to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; she said, adding that she would not be
able to sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is so much to say, so much to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she talked, dry-eyed now, for she had conquered her
emotion&mdash;her tears were because she was at home at last,
among old and happy associations once more&mdash;I was able to
see how she had aged.&nbsp; But she did not look as though her
life with Ronnie had been a failure.&nbsp; There was no careworn
anxious suggestion; there was merely <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>sadness in her loss, and
fatigue.&nbsp; She was still beautiful.</p>
<p>I did not want to ask any questions, and the principal one was
answered by her general demeanour with regard to Ronnie: they had
been happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret nothing,&rdquo; her eyes seemed to say.</p>
<p>She had no plans.&nbsp; She did not know what she would do
after leaving me.&nbsp; How was every one?&nbsp; Was Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman still living?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; She was sorry.&nbsp;
She had been hoping to talk with her.&nbsp; How splendid, though,
to find Suzanne!</p>
<p>She seemed to be shy of referring to Rose again.&nbsp; I could
not help noticing it.&nbsp; Every silence seemed to be filled
intensely with consideration of her relations with her child and
her child&rsquo;s attitude to her.&nbsp; She must have given
endless thought to this matter, but to be so near brought it all
back more vividly and critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose&mdash;&rdquo; she began once and stopped, and
I knew that the rest of the sentence would have
been&mdash;&ldquo;she knows&rdquo;: meaning &ldquo;she knows
about me and Ronnie?&rdquo;&nbsp; Did daughters, she must often
have asked herself, forgive mothers who run away from them with
other men?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because her mind had travelled thus far that
she suddenly said again, &ldquo;Dombeen, remember this.&nbsp; No
matter how sad I may seem to be, now and then, remember this: I
regret nothing.&nbsp; Ronnie needed me more than
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she became gayer and smiled her old smile.</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How are
you?&nbsp; What beautiful white hair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seventy,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing else
is the matter.&nbsp; But I always maintain that white hair is
beautiful only on the heads of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came at last to Rose again by a more direct route.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those pictures&rdquo;&mdash;looking at the
walls&mdash;&ldquo;are they hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said that they were.&nbsp; I had told her in my letters of
Rose&rsquo;s painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they&rsquo;re very good,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad.&nbsp; There should always be an artist
in our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should I tell her of Rose&rsquo;s career, due to begin
to-morrow?&nbsp; My natural instinct, as always, was, at the
moment, for fear of giving pain, to conceal it; but I remembered
my lesson, learned both from Rose and Rose, and told her.</p>
<p>She was silent for some time.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where is
she?&rdquo; she then asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone to bed,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;most
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without coming to say good night to you?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked at me
searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew you were here,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew!&nbsp; How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She saw you with me, from the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She was silent again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to bed now, I
think,&rdquo; she said, and I led her upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow your old room will be ready for you,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>&ldquo;I like this one,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where you get the view between the two copper
beeches.&nbsp; But Rose?&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must
just peep at her before I sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I advised against it.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re not so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, now, or she could not rest.</p>
<p>I pointed out Rose&rsquo;s door and she tiptoed in.&nbsp; In a
moment she was on the landing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The bed is untouched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is she?&nbsp; This is terrible,&rdquo; she
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her not to be alarmed.&nbsp; Rose was probably walking
off her disturbance of mind.&nbsp; The sudden appearance of her
mother must, I know, have given her too much to think of, and she
was doing what she often did in moments of high tension&mdash;she
was fighting her perplexities under the open sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have been
better for me not to have come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
to your room now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait for Rose&mdash;perhaps
I&rsquo;ll go and look for her, but I don&rsquo;t think that is
necessary; these are safe parts.&nbsp; She is probably in the
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;she
hasn&rsquo;t gone away altogether?&rdquo; her mother
faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, no!&nbsp; She often does this, and with
far less reason.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll knock and reassure <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>you very
soon now&rdquo;; and thus I got her to retire.&nbsp; Rose came
back some anxious hours later, at dawn.&nbsp; She was worn
out.</p>
<p>It was as I had guessed.&nbsp; The poor child&rsquo;s castle
in the air having collapsed, she had been collecting energy for
the rebuilding.&nbsp; But this time there was to be a less
alluring site: the castle must be on the prosaic earth and the
foundations dug by the dull spade, duty.</p>
<p>All this her tired face told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Dombeen!&rdquo; she said as she seized my arm and
clung to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Red Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night?&nbsp; So late?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was wondering if it would not be better in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, now.&nbsp; For a moment only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left her at her mother&rsquo;s door.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I was up early the next day, but Rose&mdash;the younger
Rose&mdash;for all her late hours, was before me.</p>
<p>I found her at the breakfast table dressed in her ordinary
morning blue overall.&nbsp; She was wan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
aren&rsquo;t you ready for the train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent some telegrams.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make it more difficult,&rdquo; Rose
replied, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t countermanded the car,&rdquo;
I said, after a few moments of swift thought; for I could see
that something must be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;there was no hurry for that,&rdquo; she
mumbled brokenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve got to go to London anyway,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was going with you,&rdquo; I added, as a
mendacious but brilliant afterthought, &ldquo;but I was keeping
it as a surprise.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was thus that I got away.&nbsp; I had realized directly
I heard Rose&rsquo;s decision that this was no place for
me.&nbsp; I was an interloper.&nbsp; Mother and daughter must
solve their own problems, and solve them alone; they would be
glad to be unobserved as they reconnoitred to ascertain each
other&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; I have stumbled upon that military
phrase, but on second thoughts I recognize its fitness; for in a
sense they were foes, as most women can be, and mother and
daughter too often actually are.&nbsp; How they would have
adjusted their relations had these fourteen estranging years not
intervened, no one could say.&nbsp; They might have been happy;
certainly they would often have been merry and care-free, for
that was the natural tendency of both.&nbsp; Moreover, there
might have been an extra bond&mdash;I have seen it often&mdash;in
mutual refuge from the Master of the House.&nbsp; But between
mothers and daughters a certain <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>hostility, not unconnected with
rivalry, is only too common, if not inevitable.&nbsp; For a
mother, be she ever so sweet-natured and generous and proud of
her daughter, is also a woman, and women love love, and hate the
thought of the shelf, and resent the younger generation&rsquo;s
vista of triumphs.&nbsp; Not until they are much older than Rose
do they consent to retire from the lists, forgive their
successors, and take with serenity to gardening and cards.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Whether or no Rose knew I was lying, I had no notion; but she
acquiesced naturally enough and waved me a wistful good-bye.</p>
<p>I too had plenty to think of as the train bore me
Londonwards.&nbsp; For everything had changed&mdash;Rose&rsquo;s
return was a bomb-shell.&nbsp; Had she come back a day later when
her daughter was established in her Hostel and the London
machinery had begun, all would have been simpler.&nbsp; But
now?&nbsp; I knew them both so well&mdash;the mother and the
daughter equally determined on any course they undertook: the
daughter, after her vigil, so bent upon sacrifice and capable
even of extracting some pleasurable gall from it, and the mother
so unwilling to cool young ardencies and spoil young hopes.</p>
<p>To which did I owe the greater allegiance?&nbsp; To the
mother, of course.&nbsp; The girl was at the threshold and had
youth and enthusiasm and <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>purpose; the mother was broken and
without a star.&nbsp; If the mother would come to me, how gladly
would I open my arms once more!&nbsp; But would she?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; How could she, knowing what people would say, having to
meet the cold eyes of the rector and his wife, and seeing
children withdrawn from her presence?&nbsp; Wherever she made her
home it could not be in my house.</p>
<p>But&mdash;the thought came later, in a flash&mdash;it could
still be with me: if somewhere else!&nbsp; Somewhere where her
story was not known.&nbsp; Why should I live all my days in one
spot?&nbsp; It is true that I was devoted to it; but ought one to
be so local, so parochial?&nbsp; It was a not too admirable line
of least resistance.&nbsp; Here was the great world open to me,
and I had cowered all my days in one corner.&nbsp; Mrs.
O&rsquo;Gorman had twitted me about it; and she was a wise
woman.&nbsp; How helpful she would be to-day!&nbsp; I had a few
years left, I hoped&mdash;why should I not move to London
or&mdash;or anywhere?&nbsp; Then Rose and I could be happy
together, once more, and the other Rose could have a room always
ready for her.&nbsp; How gay we might all yet be!</p>
<p>But probably to join me again would not be the mother&rsquo;s
wish.&nbsp; She might prefer to be alone; she might fear that her
melancholy would weigh upon me.</p>
<p>All day long as I moved about London, and even as I turned
over the portfolios, I was picturing the drama in my house, a
house that possibly I <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>was to leave for ever.&nbsp;
Rose-the-less, white and tense, passionately, bitterly determined
to be her mother&rsquo;s companion; her mother gently but firmly
refusing to come into her life.&nbsp; And how would these scenes
end?&nbsp; Would the girl lose all control, and accepting the
repudiation rush angrily off?&nbsp; Might she not indeed be even
now in London?&nbsp; Or would the mother acquiesce?&nbsp; Which
was the weaker?&nbsp; I could not tell.</p>
<p>And what did they say of me?&nbsp; They might even fall out
over me, each claiming a bigger share of their poor old
foster-father.&nbsp; And, in the absence of Mrs. O&rsquo;Gorman,
no Solomon to consult!&nbsp; Perhaps I ought not to have come
away after all?</p>
<p>The journey back was an agony, even with some purchases to
gloat over, and my nervousness increased as I approached the
house.&nbsp; What should I find?&nbsp; Would both be there?&nbsp;
Would either?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I should have been more trustful of the kindly gods.&nbsp; For
Rose and Rose were waiting for me at the door, smiling at me and
at each other.&nbsp; Whatever solution they had reached satisfied
both.&nbsp; I could see that in a flash, and seeing that, I was
happy.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rose and I,&rdquo; said Rose-the-first, later that
evening when we were all cosy, &ldquo;have had a great talk,
haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;Tremendous,&rdquo; said Rose, laying her hand on
her mother&rsquo;s and stroking it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve decided that nothing must interfere
with Rose&rsquo;s plans to become an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You decided, you mean,&rdquo; said Rose-the-second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided,&rdquo; her mother repeated,
&ldquo;and so Rose is going off almost directly to her Hostel,
just as if no ghost had frightened her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mother!&rdquo; said Rose reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; Rose-the-first
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both going?&rdquo; I exclaimed in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to find a house,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve only one desire in the world, and that
is to have a house, and the reason I want a house is to be able
to invite a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Dombeen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want one
guest only.&nbsp; You.&nbsp; My greatest wish is to find a house
in some place that pleased you, where you would come, whenever
you cared, to stay with me for a little, or,&rdquo; she added
with one of her radiant smiles, &ldquo;if you liked,
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She placed her other hand on mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I am
quite a rich woman now.&nbsp; And we have been your guests so
long, Rose and I.&nbsp; I was your guest for fourteen years;
won&rsquo;t you be mine in return?&nbsp; Rose has been your guest
for fourteen years; won&rsquo;t you let her mother put you up now
and then just to show a little gratitude?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Yes, Dombeen, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Rose-the-second.&nbsp; &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to refuse us
now.&nbsp; Because although you&rsquo;re the youngest man in the
world you&rsquo;re not a boy any more, you know.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re seventy, and you must be looked after.&nbsp; You had
a horrid, frightening cold last winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; I began.&nbsp; I had no objections to
urge, but I wanted to be pressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;buts,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing that you can be permitted to
say to stop the whole plan.&nbsp; Nothing else will
serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re tired of Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I said.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And that is how it happens that I have left my old home for
ever and am finishing this story in a house overlooking the
sea.</p>
<p>But I hear Rose calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dombeen,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a
telegram from Rose saying she&rsquo;s coming by the 5.5, and she
can stay a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; I reply.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
